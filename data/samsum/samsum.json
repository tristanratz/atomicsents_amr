Any time!\r\nEnrique: I was thinking that our 4th grade students would like to check them out as well. Can I give your name and number to that teacher?\r\nFarrah: Sure thing. \r\nEnrique: I'm not sure how it fits into the lesson plan, so they may not get in touch until next semester.\r\nFarrah: Fair enough. No problem, I understand.\r\nEnrique: Thanks again! It was really interesting!\r\nFarrah: Of course! Any time, and now I have a better idea of other ones to bring next time.\r\nEnrique: That would be great.\r\nFarrah: Some of the questions really made me wish I had brought my whole collection, but that just isn't practical.\r\nEnrique: Oh, I understand.

Are you still interested?\r\nSophie: Hello Noah, but of course I am.Thank you.\r\nNoah: Actually William went to collect the rest of them for you immediately. They're in a basket on our terrace, so you call collect them any time.\r\nSophie: That's very very kind of him! He's really a darling.\r\nSophie: We won't be going your direction any time soon I'm afraid. How long will they keep? Is it windfall?\r\nNoah: Both really but they all look very healthy. No bruises afa one can see. Or only odd small ones. They' be alright for a couple of days I guess. The weather's cool.\r\nSophie: It would be a shame if they rotted. I'll talk to Frank and maybe to the twins too and go back to you asap.\r\nNoah: OK.\r\nSophie: Hey Noah, the twins will be on their way from Notts tomorrow afternoon and passing Windfield. Is it alright if they pop in and collect the quince?\r\nNoah: Absolutely! In fact anyone can come any time and just take them from our terrace. Of course it would be great to see your twins again. Haven't seen them for ages!\r\nSophie: Well we don't see that much of them either :( They'll be coming home this weekend only because of Alexa's ceremony.\r\nNoah: Notts is 3 hours' drive away so small wonder they don't fancy it so much.\r\nSophie: I don't blame them! We're both happy they've been doing fine at college. Everything's absolutely fine. You don't have William at home all that often either, do you?\r\nNoah: He gets 5 days at Xmas by way of \"family care\" and 2 weeks off spread over the whole year but never longer that 5 days. They have a strict regime at the academy. But after all these years we've learned to cope with it. What worries me is that he seems to have no time to even think about getting married and start a family of his own.\r\nSophie: The fate of most military I guess. Hugely unfair I'd say. Like being married to your regiment!\r\nNoah: That's what it sounds like when he talks about himself! I never hear a girl's name! And when I ask, he gets brusque.\r\nSophie: Oh dear! What could it mean?\r\nNoah: No, not what you think! We know from Capt. Broomsberg about their common escapades. Plenty of women but only that sort of women. No strings.\r\nSophie: I never even imagined he might be gay! Surely not. But there must be sth else.\r\nNoah: We think he's just so obsessively career-minded. Nothing else counts for him.\r\nSophie: He's always been very strong-willed. And he knows what he wants. Well if I were you I wouldn't worry at all.\r\nNoah: You're probably right. But you know I'd love it so much to have plenty of grandchildren around me.\r\nSophie: They'll come, don't you worry! Look the twins will contact you about the quince. Alright?\r\nNoah: Sure. Thank you Sophie for a nice chat!\r\nSophie: Thank you for the quince!",

Not sure, though.\r\nNancy: How about u, Vic?\r\nVic: I still prefer Facebook. Had Twitter once, but the interaction with others is nothing compared with Facebook.\r\nPhil: Well, it's intended in a completely different way. \r\nVic: What do u mean?\r\nPhil: IMO, Twitter is not for interacting like on Facebook, but for getting news fast and from reliable, more or less, sources. U can follow anyone and anyone can follow u.\r\nVic: Still, on Facebook I can share stuff with my friends, join groups and talk about things that interest me. And I don't have to limit myself to 140 characters.\r\nPhil: 280. Still, a downside. OTOH, if ppl were able to write as much as they wanted, Twitted would get as cluttered as Facebook.\r\nNancy: So no one uses 4 example Instagram?\r\nVic: I do. \r\nPhil: Not 4 me. I don't post that many pictures online. \r\nNancy: But u can follow ppl and see what they're doing or offering.

Any good?\r\nClara: Well, yes! I just said it was, LOL. It's about a fictional Ivy League University and the students in one House of Residence.\r\nNeela: Why is it called Dear White People?\r\nClara: That's the name of the radio show the main character, Sam, presents on college radio.\r\nNeela: Yeah, but why is it so good?\r\nClara: Well, it's mainly stories from the perspective of black students there, which I find very interesting. The characters are strong and likeable too.\r\nNeela: I suppose it's rather different from the UK, then?\r\nClara: It seems so, as there is a lot more racial awareness and discrimination there than here. It all kicks off when there is a Blackface party held by an elite group of white students, which gets out of hand.\r\nNeela: How's that?\r\nClara: Well, obviously, the black students try to break it up and there's also an incident where one guy, Reggie, gets a loaded gun pointed at him by a campus policeman after he gets into an argument with a white student. It may be at another party, though, I'm not sure of that.\r\nNeela: Oh, that sounds pretty strong stuff. What else happens?\r\nClara: Well, there is a young black guy called Lionel who is coming to terms with being gay and is finding his voice as a journalist. He unearths corruption at the uni and he and Sam also uncover some conspiracy theory stuff about secret societies.\r\nNeela: Well, I must say, it does sound good, I'll check it out soon!\r\nClara: Definitely, there is supposed to be a Series 3 coming up next year, really looking forward to it!\r\nNeela: Well, thanks Clara, I'm just watching the rest of a movie and I'll try Dear White People.\r\nClara: Don't blame me if you get hooked and stay up till 4!\r\nNeela: See ya, love!\r\nClara: Bye!",
