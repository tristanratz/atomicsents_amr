    "Andal Ampatuan Junior is accused of orchestrating the murder of 57 unarmed civilians, who were ambushed, killed and clumsily buried in a mass grave in the southern province of Maguindanao last November.\nAnother 27 members of his family have also been charged in connection with the killings - five are with him in custody - and they all deny the charges against them.\nBut for many Filipinos, this trial is about much more than establishing the guilt or innocence of one man, or even one family.\nIt's about the huge influence of clans like the Ampatuans, and the culture of impunity surrounding them.\nWhile their involvement in the massacre has yet to be proven, there is no doubt whatsoever that the Ampatuans were - and still are - extremely powerful.\nThe Ampatuans have been in Maguindanao for centuries, and can trace their lineage to a Muslim preacher, Shariff Aguak, who was one of the first people to bring the Islamic faith to the area.\nBut they were not always the dominant force they are today. According to Arnold Esguerra, a history professor at the University of the Philippines in Manila, the surname Ampatuan only started to appear in official documents in the early part of the 20th Century.\nAt that stage they were influential traders, he said - but their social status was definitely beneath that of the \"datus\", the traditional clan rulers.\nThe situation changed in the mid-1970s, when then-President Ferdinand Marcos declared martial law, and tried to stamp out the growing Islamic separatist movement by selecting a few people he could trust to administer the province.\nOne of those people was Andal Ampatuan Junior's father, Andal Senior, who is now the undisputed head of the family clan.\nFirst, he became the mayor of Maganoy town - and then, during the presidency of Cory Aquino, he was given the more powerful role of officer-in-charge.\nBut it was under President Gloria Arroyo, who came to power in 2001, when the Ampatuans really came to prominence.\nAndal Senior became governor of Maguindanao, a post he has now held for the maximum three terms.  Then in 2005 his son Zaldy became the governor of the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao - an influential post controlling the five Muslim provinces that have been given a degree of self-rule from central government.\n'Heights of power'\nAndal Junior became mayor of Datu Unsay, a town that bears his nickname, and at the time of the massacre, 10 of Maguindanao's 34 municipalities were run by Ampatuans or their relatives.\nMrs Arroyo's government was good to the Ampatuans, providing funds for the region, and in the process propelling Andal Senior to \"undreamed-of heights of power\", according to a report by the International Crisis Group.\nIn 2006, Mrs Arroyo issued an executive order legalising the informal private \"armies\" being kept by families like the Ampatuans, enabling them to work alongside the regular army - but by extension legitimising their use as a means of local control.\nIn return the Ampatuans openly supported her in election campaigns.\nThere are widespread claims that the family helped rig votes for Mrs Arroyo in the controversial 2004 election, which she narrowly won. Both the Ampatuans and the former president deny the allegations.\nAt the time of the massacre, the clan had an estimated 28 mansions, scores of luxury cars, large amounts of rice-producing land and a heavily armed private army of more than 2,000 men.\nAccording to the International Crisis Group, the Ampatuans also controlled the police, the judiciary and the local election commission, and possessed mortars, rocket launchers and assault rifles.\nEven now, after the finger of blame has been pointed at them for the November massacre, the family still retains a lot of its influence. At least 15 Ampatuans won victories in May's election - some of whom have charges against them.\nAnd according to Jessica Evans from Human Rights Watch, Andal Senior is still able to give orders to his subordinates from inside jail.\nOf course none of this means the Ampatuans are necessarily guilty of the killings, or that all members of the clan act in a similar way.\nIn fact, according to Amina Rasul, director of the Philippine Council on Islam and Democracy, some Ampatuans are very effective and popular community leaders.\n\"They're not all cut from the same cloth. Many are professional, and have real support,\" she said.\nBut human rights groups are still concerned about the dominance of these family clans, and they warn that the influence and power exhibited by the Ampatuans is by no means unique.\n\"I don't think this is an isolated incident,\" said Amina Rasul. \"There are other families in other parts of the Philippines that are just as powerful.\"\nThe Philippine military recently admitted that there were at least 112 private armies around the country - an indication, perhaps, of how many more clans and family groups hold sway over their own private fiefdoms.\nWhether by chance or design, presidential policies over the past few decades have given certain families the opportunity to amass extraordinary levels of power and influence.\nThe first priority of the trial into last November's massacre is undoubtedly to bring justice for those who were so brutally killed.\nBut human rights groups are hoping that the case will also persuade the current government, under President Benigno Aquino, to bring an end to the dominance of families like the Ampatuans.",
    "So what is the levy? What's really at stake? And why raise the rate now?\nWhat is the bank levy?\nIt is an annual tax on the value of all of the debts of the UK banks (including money deposited with the banks), except that:\nOriginally, the Treasury had planned to charge a lower rate of 0.05% during 2011, but in February it changed its mind, and switched to the standard rate of 0.075% from May.\nThe standard rate was originally set at 0.075%, but it was raised slightly in March to 0.078%, and is now being raised again, to 0.088%, from January.\nWhat's it for?\nThe government thinks it will discourage banks from relying on risky forms of borrowing, which were blamed for making the 2008 crisis much more dangerous.\nThe tax will also raise a lot of money for the government.\nSo will this help deal with the budget deficit?\nThe Treasury hopes the tax will bring in \u00a32.6bn every year.\nThat's equivalent to 2.1% of the Office for Budget Responsibility's forecast for the budget deficit this year.\nIt's no small amount for the banks either. It's equivalent to about 19% of the reported profits before tax of the big five UK banks over the 12 months to September this year - although the tax burden will be borne by more than just these five.\nWhat's risky about the type of borrowing that the government wants to discourage?\nTraditionally, most of the money that banks lend out comes from the deposits they receive from ordinary people and companies.\nBut during the past decade, banks found new and more complex ways to borrow trillions of pounds from international markets.\nUnlike ordinary deposits, there is no natural limit on the availability of this money, as it can come from anywhere in the globe, and the same money can be recycled between the banks again and again.\nA lot of the debts created were very short-term - meaning the banks needed to go back to the markets to reborrow every few days.\nWhen the financial crisis hit, investors began to worry that banks might not be able to repay their debts.\nThis caused a kind of bank run, with investors refusing to lend.\nUnable to refinance all of their short-term debts, even profitable banks were threatened with failure.\nWhy are retail deposits exempt from the levy?\nBank runs are popularly associated with long queues of ordinary depositors wanting to empty their bank accounts - just as happened to Northern Rock.\nBut since the 1930s, governments have insured most of the money deposited by their citizens in order to discourage these depositor bank runs. Indeed, the government responded to the Northern Rock crisis by promising to guarantee all of its deposits.\nIn the UK, the first \u00a385,000 of an individual's money is insured (it used to be \u00a335,000 before the financial crisis).\nThis means that most depositors do not need to worry about the safety of their money during a financial crisis, and the banks don't need to worry about all those deposits being withdrawn.\nSo why not just insure all the banks' borrowings?\nThe bank levy was actually first proposed to all countries by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as a type of insurance scheme.\nThe IMF said the money raised should be channelled into a special fund that could be used to pay for the cost of cleaning up future banking crises.\nHowever, the UK government took the view that these borrowings are inherently risky, and wanted to discourage them altogether by taxing them.\nIf the debts were insured, lenders would see them as less risky, making them a cheaper and easier way for banks to borrow.\nThe government's fear is that the banks would then just continue taking on more and more debt, until they became impossibly large to rescue - as proved the case in the Republic of Ireland or Iceland.\nIndeed, the total debts of the UK's banks had already reached a staggering 4.5 times the size of the entire UK economy before the crisis.\nSome might also point out another reason why the government chose not to go for an insurance scheme.\nBy making it a tax instead, the revenue raised can be channelled straight to the Treasury, helping to pay for the government's own spending.\nWhy is the first \u00a320bn of debts exempt from the tax?\nThe government wants to encourage banks to shrink.\nThe thinking is that the collapse of a big bank could threaten the stability of the entire financial system, whereas the failure of a small bank should not.\nThe \u00a320bn figure is about the size of the Coventry Building Society. So it means banks will only pay the tax to the extent they are bigger than that.\nWhy is the tax rate lower on long-term debts?\nLonger-term debts are inherently less risky.\nFinancial crises - at least the most intense part of them - tend to be over in a matter of a few weeks or months.\nIf a bank does not have to repay its debts for more than a year, then it can probably ride out the crisis.\nWill the levy really discourage banks?\nThe tax will increase the cost of \"risky\" short-term borrowing for banks by just under one-tenth of a percentage point.\nThis may seem small, but it will eat into the banks' precious margins - the difference between the interest they pay on their deposits and what they earn on their lending - which is their main source of income.\nHowever, the banks may pass some of the tax cost on to their savers (via a lower deposit rate) or their borrowers (via a higher lending rate).\nBut to get the 0.088% in context, the Bank of England slashed short-term borrowing costs by 5.2 percentage points in response to the financial crisis.\nWhy did the government want to phase the levy in?\nThe original plan was to charge 0.05% for 2011, before going up to the full 0.075% rate next year (increased to 0.078% in March).\nThe government didn't want to raise the banks' borrowing costs at a time when their financial stability was still in question.\nThey also did not want to sap the banks' profits too quickly.\nThe banks might need to use all the profits they could get to rebuild their capital - their buffer against future losses - in order to meet tough new international standards being set by the Basel committee of banking regulators.\nSo why did the government change its mind?\nIn February, the Treasury said it wanted to charge the full \u00a32.6bn this year after all.\nIt pointed to the Bank of England's latest Financial Stability Report, which painted a much rosier picture of the UK's banks.\nMoreover, the new Basel rules on bank capital won't take full effect until 2019, giving banks a full eight years to meet the higher standards.\nIt probably also helped that the banks have been reporting much better profits than many would have expected a year ago.\nAnd markets seemed less and less concerned about the risk of lending to banks - at least until the eurozone debt crisis flared up since the summer of 2011.\nWhy is the government raising the rate again?\nThe chancellor raised the rate to 0.088% in his Autumn Statement.\nAccording to the Treasury, the tax was not on course to raise the \u00a32.6bn originally planned for this year.\nThe Treasury said that it had simply overestimated how much borrowing is done by foreign banks in the UK - and is therefore subject to the tax.\nIt could also be that banks have been reducing their borrowing. Foreign banks may be moving their borrowing offshore to avoid the tax.\nAnd all banks may be cutting back their borrowing and lending requirements in response to the recession, the eurozone financial crisis, and stricter regulatory requirements.\nWhich banks will have to pay most?\nThe Treasury does not say how much of its \u00a32.6bn target it expects to be paid by each bank.\nBritish banks face a bigger burden than foreign banks that do business in the UK, because the British banks must pay the levy on all their borrowing worldwide, and not just on their borrowing in the UK.\nThat has led to suggestions that some banks - perhaps Standard Chartered, HSBC and Barclays - may relocate their headquarters to another country in order to reduce their tax bill.\nMoreover, the probability is that the tax will hit Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group hardest.\nIt may seem perverse to tax most heavily the two banks in which the government has the biggest stake.\nBut one of the reasons the government ended up owning these banks is precisely because they (in the case of Lloyds, because of its merger with the Halifax) had become too dependent on riskier forms of financing, and had to be rescued during the crisis.",

    "Quite simply, if the GDP measure is up on the previous three months, the economy is growing. If it is negative it is contracting.\nAnd two consecutive three-month periods of contraction mean an economy is in recession.\nGDP can be measured in three ways:\nIn theory all three approaches should produce the same number.\nIn the UK the Office for National Statistics (ONS) publishes one single measure of GDP which, apart from the first estimate, is calculated using all three ways of measuring.\nUsually the main interest in the UK figures is in the quarterly change in GDP in real terms, that is after taking into account changes in prices (inflation).\nCalculating a GDP estimate for all three measures is a huge undertaking every three months.\nThe output measure alone - which is considered the most accurate in the short term - involves surveying tens of thousands of UK firms.\nThe main sources used for this are ONS surveys of manufacturing and service industries.\nInformation on sales is collected from 6,000 companies in manufacturing, 25,000 service sector firms, 5,000 retailers and 10,000 companies in the construction sector.\nData is also collected from government departments covering activities such as agriculture, energy, health and education.\nThe UK produces the earliest estimate of GDP of the major economies, around 25 days after the quarter in question.\nThis provides policymakers with an early, or \"flash\", estimate of the real growth in economic activity. It is quick, but only based on the output measure.\nAt that stage only about 40% of the data is available, so this figure is revised as more information comes in.\nThey are two subsequent revisions at monthly intervals. But this isn't the end.\nRevisions can be made as much as 18 months to two years after the first \"flash\" estimate. The ONS publishes more information on how this is done  on its website.\nGDP is the principal means of determining the health of the UK economy and is used by the Bank of England and its Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) as one of the key indicators in setting interest rates.\nSo, for example, if prices are rising too fast, the Bank would be expected to increase interest rates to try to control them. But it may hold off if GDP growth is sluggish, as higher rates could damage the recovery. That is the situation at the moment.\nThe Treasury also uses GDP when planning economic policy. When an economy is contracting, tax receipts tend to fall, and the government adjusts its tax and spending plans accordingly.\nUK GDP is used internationally by the various financial bodies such as OECD, IMF, and the World Bank to compare the performance of different economies.\nThe European Union also uses GDP estimates as a basis for determining different countries' contributions to the EU budget.\nThe information in this article was provided by the Office for National Statistics.",
    "Police have charged a 32-year-old Norwegian man over both attacks.\nThe man dressed as a police officer was arrested on tiny Utoeya island after an hour-long shooting spree.\nPrime Minister Jens Stoltenberg said many people were still looking for their children and had not so far been able to locate them.\nHe was speaking after meeting victims and relatives with Norway's King Harald, Queen Sonja and Crown Prince Haakon in the town of Sundvollen near the island.\nValues attackedHome-grown plot?In pictures: Shock\nMr Stoltenberg said he was \"deeply touched\" by the meetings. \"We will do whatever we can to give them as much support as possible,\" he said.\nEarlier he said that he was due to have been on Utoeya - \"a youth paradise turned into a hell\" - a few hours after the attack took place.\nThe suspect is reported by local media to have had links with right-wing extremists. He has been named as Anders Behring Breivik. Police searched his Oslo apartment overnight and are questioning him.\nThe BBC's Richard Galpin, near the island which is currently cordoned off by police, says that Norway has had problems with neo-Nazi groups in the past but the assumption was that such groups had been largely eliminated and did not pose a significant threat.\nPolice say they are investigating whether the attacks were the work of one man or whether others helped.\n\"At Utoeya, the water is still being searched for more victims,\" deputy police chief Roger Andresen told reporters.\n\"We have no more information than... what has been found on [his] own websites, which is that it goes towards the right and that it is, so to speak, Christian fundamentalist.\"\nBy Richard GalpinBBC News, near Utoeya\nA search is going on not just on the island itself, but also in the waters around it because a lot of people tried to escape by jumping in the water and trying to swim away. Even as they did that, eyewitnesses say, the gunman opened fire on them.\nThe chatter now is that it took the police an hour, if not an hour and a half, to actually get to the island. Of course that gave the gunman so much time to kill so many people.\nAlso crucially, the police were throwing all their resources at the huge bomb attack which had just taken place in the centre of Oslo.\nBut still, the question will be asked: Were there not police nearer to this area who could have moved in much more quickly?\nLocal media report that police are investigating claims by witnesses that a second person was involved, apparently not disguised in a police uniform.\nA farm supply firm has confirmed selling six tonnes of fertiliser to Mr Breivik who is reported to have run a farming company. Speculation has been rife that fertiliser could have been used in the Oslo bomb.\nThe number killed in the island shooting spree, which is among the world's most deadly, had been put at 10 on Friday - but soared overnight. Hundreds of young people had been attending the summer camp organised by the governing Labour Party on Utoeya island.\nEyewitnesses described how a tall, blond man dressed as a policeman opened fire indiscriminately, prompting camp attendees to jump into the water to try to escape the hail of bullets.\nSome of the teenagers were shot at as they tried to swim to safety.\nArmed police were deployed to the island but details of the operation to capture the suspect remain unclear. After his arrest he was charged with committing acts of terrorism.\nProfile: Anders Behring Breivik\nPolice say they discovered many more victims after searching the area around the island. They have warned the death toll may rise further as rescue teams continue to scour the waters around the island.\nThe gunman is reported to have been armed with a handgun, an automatic weapon and a shotgun.\n\"He travelled on the ferry boat from the mainland over to that little inland island posing as a police officer, saying he was there to do research in connection with the bomb blasts,\" NRK journalist Ole Torp told the BBC.\n\"He asked people to gather round and then he started shooting, so these young people fled into the bushes and woods and some even swam off the island to get to safety.\"\nOne 15-year-old eyewitness described how she saw what she thought was a police officer open fire.\n\"He first shot people on the island. Afterward he started shooting people in the water,\" youth camp delegate Elise told Associated Press.\nThe attacks sparked strong international condemnation, with US President Barack Obama expressing his condolences and offering support.\nBritain's Queen Elizabeth II spoke of her shock and sadness in a letter to King Harald.\nIn Oslo, government officials urged people to stay at home and avoid central areas of the city.\nShards of twisted metal, rubble and glass littered the streets of central Oslo left devastated by Friday's enormous explosion.\nWindows in the buildings of the government quarter were shattered and witnesses described how smoke filled the atmosphere around the blast site.\nThe BBC's John Sopel in Oslo says there is a heavy military presence, with checkpoints around the quarter.\nMr Stoltenberg said civil servants were among the dead in Oslo and he knew some of those killed.\nThere are also concerns that more victims may still be inside buildings hit by the initial massive explosion.",
    "The Restore Justice campaign, spearheaded by Paul Staines who writes the Guido Fawkes political blog, calls for the death penalty to be brought back for child and police officer murderers.\nHe cites opinion polls which suggest about half the population would like it re-introduced for murderers. This rises to 60% when it comes to child or police officer killers.\nMr Staines needs 100,000 people to support his e-petition on the government website to prompt a possible parliamentary debate on the issue.\nThe last executions in the UK took place in 1964. The death penalty was formally abolished in Britain in 1965 and in Northern Ireland in 1973.\nDespite it rating high on public opinion polls, it was last debated in Parliament in 1998 during the passage of the Human Rights Act. It was rejected by 158 votes.\n\"The majority are in favour for bringing back the death penalty everywhere except in Parliament,\" said Mr Staines.\n\"Politicians are complaining that there's a disconnect and that the public aren't engaged with them - maybe if they represented the views and the will of the voters, there wouldn't be such a big disconnect.\"\nHe added: \"The people want the death penalty, and politicians aren't prepared to vote for it. That's not right.\n\"What I'm trying to do is get Parliament to discuss this issue between what Parliament wants and what the people want.\"\nHouse of Commons leader Sir George Young has warned that it would damage democracy to ignore strong opinions among members of the public \"or pretend that their views do not exist\".\nDouglas Carswell MP agreed, saying, although he was firmly against the death penalty, he was in favour of Parliament debating it and would support a referendum on whether it should be brought back.\n\"I'm convinced that if there was a referendum on capital punishment we could win it; we could get most people to say 'no' to the death penalty.\n\"We need to treat people as grown-ups and have the debate and not do what we have done for half a century which is to ignore the public's concern and treat them with contempt.\n\"The important thing is we have this debate.\"\nMr Carswell added that the reason why Parliament had not debated this topic in recent years was because it was \"out of touch with the public\".\n\"The mistake MPs have made is to not trust the people and to try and ignore their concerns. We can disagree with it but we have to trust it.\"\nBut Neil Durkin from Amnesty International said it was a \"waste of time and money that we as a nation cannot afford\".\nIn September 2010, YouGov conducted the last opinion poll to ask directly if people want the death penalty re-instated. It suggested that 51% did.\nAnd a Mori poll in July 2010 asked people which of a list of crimes they thought should have the death penalty.\nFor child murder, 62% supported it while a YouGov poll in November 2010 found 74% of people supported the death penalty for murder in some circumstances, though only 16% supported it for all murders.\nHowever, when similar polls were carried out in the 1970s, support for it was far higher with 70% in favour.\nAnthony Wells, associate director of YouGov, says polls which ask about the death penalty are straightforward: \"Do you support it or not?\"\n\"When people already know about it and have established views then it is quite simple. The hard ones [opinion polls] are when people need to have an issue explained to them.\"\nHe said historically opinion polls on capital punishment have been commissioned by newspapers when there has been a heinous crime such as after the Soham murders.\nMr Wells added that such polls are not often commissioned in times when a high-profile murder is not in the news. However, the last two polls on the subject were not about a specific case, being conducted for a story about sentencing for murder and for a Channel 4 programme.\nPolls are quite accurate, plus or minus 3%, said Mr Wells, and their accuracy can be checked against real life events such as who is going to win the election or X Factor.\n\"All the polls about the death penalty show similar patterns so even if it was worded differently it would still get the same result,\" he added.\n\"You can only tell what people think at the moment, but if it follows current trends then yes, I'd expect it to go down.\"\nMr Durkin from Amnesty International said it was important to have an informed debate, rather than a simple \"yes or no\" question.\n\"Public opinion polls are usually conducted after a particularly horrible murder that's had lots of publicity so you do tend to get that outcry.\n\"On top of that, when we have looked at opinion polls in the US, most people tend to think that the US is firmly in terms of public opinion pro death penalty.\n\"If you offer in those questions to the public alternatives to capital punishment - the lethal injections, the electrocutions, whatever it is - and talk about longer sentences then support drops away.\"",
    "Now the carmaker has confirmed that it will release an all-new version of the Defender in 2015.\nA concept car on which the new Defender will be based is set to make its public debut at next month's Frankfurt motor show.\nArguably, the overhaul cannot come too soon for a vehicle that now feels hopelessly outdated next to the company's latest offering, the Range Rover Evoque.\nGoing from a rugged Defender to a flashy-looking Evoque is a major step.\nHowever, whether it is a step in the right direction is not clear - it really depends on what you want.\nWith its roomy, minimalist cabin and a square body, which many say only looks better once it has had a few knocks, the current Defender is obviously better suited as a serious workhorse.\nBut for the fashion-conscious who prefer a more comfortable ride and a lavishly fitted out interior, the Evoque might be a better bet.\nThe same may well be true for Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), the UK-based Tata Motors subsidiary that hopes to boost the profits it makes from both Range Rover and Land Rover vehicles.\nLand Rover is eager to conquer new markets at a time when competent rivals are enjoying great success in attracting farmers, workers and soldiers, offering them working vehicles that are often both better and cheaper than the Defender.\nLand Rover's global brand director, John Edwards, is hopeful the Evoque's lightweight construction and relatively low fuel consumption and emissions make it well suited to the job.\n\"This car will be our best-selling model,\" he says in an interview with BBC News, predicting that it will outsell Land Rover's Freelander, Discovery and Defender models, as well as the full-size Range Rover and Range Rover Sport.\n\"The sports utility vehicle (SUV) market is growing, but downsizing, and the premium market is growing in general,\" he observes. \"This meets those two trends quite well.\"\nCrowned Car of the Year 2011 by Auto Express, the Evoque is expected to broaden Land Rover's customer base.\nAbout half the buyers of the compact Evoque SUV are expected to be women, compared with just a quarter of Land Rover's current customers, and it is also expected to appear to a younger audience.\nMany of them will probably opt for a cheaper and more frugal two-wheel-drive version, rather than one kitted out with four-wheel-drive.\nMoreover, some 80% of the Evoques, which will be made at Land Rover's Halewood factory, will be sold abroad.\n\"We intend it to be a global car,\" Mr Edwards says.\nBut the Evoque is more than just a response to the market, according to Land Rover's managing director, Colin Green.\n\"With previous cars like the Freelander and Discovery, we've been looking at emerging segments, whereas with the Evoque we're trying to identify 'white space',\" he tells BBC News in an interview.\n\"The design has led the package, rather than the functionality leading the design.\"\nThat seems to be a major change in philosophy for Land Rover, which has traditionally been one of the most pragmatic, problem-solving companies in the motor industry.\nIt is also a strategy that is changing the company's makeup, with its upmarket Range Rover models destined to outshine its Land Rover models.\n\"I think Range Rover will make up more than 50% of sales by 2030,\" Mr Green says.\nThis might suggest a shift away from the company's core offroad values.\nBut Mr Edwards is eager to stress that the Evoque is \"just as capable, if not more capable on some surfaces, than some of our other models\".\n\"They offer luxury, plus the Land Rover capability,\" he says.\nDriving the Evoque on rutted tracks in Snowdonia makes it clear that the company's smaller, cheaper Range Rover is not a soft-roader. It is a perfectly able offroad vehicle, even when faced with fairly serious challenges.\nAnd with most of its offroad capabilities controlled by electronics, such as an adaptive damping system, it is also much smoother in the rough, with little room for human error by the button-pressing iPad generation that is expected to be buying it.\nThat prompts the question: redesign or no redesign, is the Defender quite simply obsolete?\n\"It's very long in the tooth,\" acknowledges Mr Edwards, though he nevertheless insists the Defender remains relevant.\n\"It's very important that we don't forget Land Rover and its capability. We are working very hard on the non-Range Rover badge products in our range.\n\"Replacing [the Defender] is going to be quite a challenge, but also an opportunity,\" says Mr Edwards. \"But we're definitely doing it.\n\"We'll want to replace the car as it currently occupies the market. We certainly don't want to move it upmarket and become a sort of 'Range Rover Defender'. That doesn't work at all.\"\n\"One of our problems in the past looking to replace the Defender has been to get the business case together,\" observes managing director Mr Green. \"Military contracts are fine, but you might get 5,000 orders one year, 200 the next.\"\nA more promising market might be in developing countries such as Brazil, Russia, India and China, where working vehicle sales are booming in parallel with rapid economic growth that is predicted to continue for decades yet.\nTo succeed in these markets, a new Defender will need to be able to compete on both price and quality. It will  need to be both cheaper - so the cost of production will need to come down - and better, in terms of both capabilities and fuel economy.\nAnd that may well prove an even trickier challenge than the creation of an urban warrior with designer looks.",
    "Residents living around the Good Hope Hospital in Sutton Coldfield have said cars are being illegally parked on local streets by staff and patients.\nPaul Quinsey, head of technical services, said the hospital is looking at demountable parking decks above existing car parks as one solution.\nHe said there are currently 626 staff waiting for a parking space.\nRoger Bayliss, who had an appointment for an X-ray at the hospital, said he spent more than an hour looking for a parking space.\nHe said: \"I would have abandoned my appointment had I been able to turn around and get out of the hospital, but the traffic was so gridlocked all across the site there was absolutely no option but to sit and wait.\"\nConservative councillor David Pears, who represents the Sutton Trinity Ward which covers the Good Hope hospital, said residents had put up with parking problems for \"far too long\".\nHe said: \"We've met with the hospital, we've got the MP involved, but it just seems the hospital is unwilling to spend money on a scheme that will make life easier for the residents.\"\nMr Quinsey said the hospital is working alongside its publicly elected governors and staff to see how it can address the current issues around parking.\nHe said a plan to set up a park-and-ride scheme had been rejected because of its affordability and long transfer times.",
    "Since regaining its independence with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Estonia has become one of the most economically successful of the European Union's newer eastern European members.\nRuled at various times during the middle ages by Denmark, the German knights of the Livonian Order, and Sweden, Estonia ended up part of the Russian Empire in the 18th century.\nIt experienced its first period of independence in 1918, following the end of the First World War and the collapse of the Russian Empire.\nCountry profiles compiled by BBC Monitoring\nBut the new state, which underwent periods of both democratic and authoritarian rule, was short-lived.\nAfter only 20 years, Estonia was forcefully incorporated into Soviet Union in 1940, following a pact between Hitler and Stalin. German troops occupied Estonia during World War II, before being driven out by the Soviet army.\nFew nations formally recognised the Soviet annexation, and Estonians consider it an illegal occupation.\nOne of its legacies is a large Russian minority - about a quarter of the population, according to the 2011 census. In Soviet times, the influx of non-Estonians led some to fear for the survival of Estonian culture and language.\nThe Russians' status has been a cause of controversy. Some, including the Russian government, criticise requirements needed to obtain Estonian citizenship - especially the need to show a proficiency in the Estonian language - that left most ethnic Russians stateless after independence.\nEstonia says the criteria for citizenship are similar to those of most nations around the world, and have been in any case gradually eased. It says the number of stateless persons has dropped by 80% between 1992 and 2013.\nSince independence, Estonia has politically and economically anchored itself firmly to the West, joining the EU and Nato in 2004. It sent a contingent of troops as part of Nato operations in Afghanistan.\nRussia's intervention in the Ukrainian crisis in 2014 has triggered some nervousness in Estonia over President Vladimir Putin's intentions towards other former Soviet states. The Estonian government has been fiercely critical of Russia's behaviour and has affirmed its pro-Nato stance in response to the events in Ukraine.\nEstonian governments have tended to pursue strongly free-market economic policies, privatising state enterprises, introducing a flat-rate income tax, liberalising regulation, encouraging free trade and keeping public debt low.\nThere has also been a strong emphasis on making Estonia a world leader in technology, leading some to speak of an \"e-economy\".\nThis has included creating one of the world's fastest broadband networks, offering widespread free wireless internet, encouraging technology start-ups and putting government services online. In 2007, Estonia was the first country to allow online voting in a general election.\nThe country experienced an investment boom in the early 2000s, especially after EU membership, with high annual growth rates hovering between 7-10%.\nIn 2008, Estonia's economy was hit by the global financial crisis. The government adopted tough austerity measures and won plaudits for getting the economy back into shape.\nThe country joined the European single currency in January 2011.\nThe Estonian language is closely related to Finnish and - more distantly - Hungarian, but not to the Indo-European languages of the two other Baltic states - Latvia and Lithuania - or Russian for that matter.\nThe country has unique musical and dance traditions, including a long tradition of choral singing.",
    "Ministers are to increase the maximum discount - currently \u00a316,000 to \u00a338,000 - to more than the expected \u00a350,000.\nThey hope it will persuade more tenants and mortgage lenders to get involved in the scheme first started in the 1980s.\nBut housing charity Shelter says the plans risk diminishing the stock of \"genuinely affordable\" social housing.\nIt also says the plans could saddle low-income families with mortgage debts they cannot afford.\nThe \"right to buy\" scheme was first started under Margaret Thatcher's government.\nIn December the government launched a consultation on \"re-invigorating\" the right to buy, which has dwindled in recent years, and suggested the maximum discount may be raised to \u00a350,000.\nCurrently, discount levels differ across the country, ranging from \u00a316,000 to \u00a338,000.\nNow ministers believe discounts should be as high as \u00a375,000, the BBC understands.\nThe government insists all social homes that are sold \"will be replaced on a one-for-one basis by a new affordable rent property, ensuring there is no reduction in the number of affordable homes\".\nBut Shelter says it will still have the effect of damaging social housing.\nRoger Harding, Shelter's head of policy, research and public affairs, said: \"The government is not going to replace like-with-like.\n\"The 'affordable rent' model means landlords can charge rents of up to 80% of market rates, which is typically higher than council rents.\n\"The net result will be a reduction in the number of genuinely affordable homes for families on modest incomes.\"\nHe added: \"That could have the added effect of pushing up the housing benefit bill, if there are fewer council houses and more 'affordable rent' properties with higher rental costs.\"\nMr Harding said: \"We are also concerned that ownership is not necessarily the most financially suitable form of tenure for a lot of social housing tenants.\n\"Many are on very low incomes and could find themselves unable to afford the mortgage repayments. Statistically, right-to-buy mortgage holders are far more likely than other purchasers to have their homes repossessed.\"\nLater this week Housing Minister Grant Shapps is expected to say: \"This coalition government backs the dreams of those who want to own the roof over their own head.\"\nHe has promised to triple or even quadruple the discounts available to \"hard-working families\".\nMr Shapps will say: \"New home buyers will have the satisfaction of knowing that for each property sold, we'll be aiming to replace it with a new affordable home for the record numbers left languishing on Labour's housing waiting lists.\n\"It's a win/win that backs aspirational council tenants whilst dealing with the legacy of Labour's record waiting lists.\"",

    "Malala Yousafzai was attacked on her way home from school in Mingora, the region's main town.\nShe came to public attention in 2009 by writing a diary for BBC Urdu about life under Taliban militants who had taken control of the valley.\nA Pakistani Taliban spokesman told the BBC they carried out the attack.\nEhsanullah Ehsan told BBC Urdu that they attacked her because she was anti-Taliban and secular, adding that she would not be spared.\nMalala Yousafzai was travelling with at least one other girl when she was shot, but there are differing accounts of how events unfolded.\nBy Orla GuerinBBC News, Islamabad\nThe chilling attack on the young peace campaigner has been leading TV news bulletins here. Malala Yousafzai is one of the best-known schoolgirls in the country.  Young as she is, she has dared to do what many others do not - publicly criticise the Taliban.\nMalala's confident, articulate campaign for girls' education has won her admirers - and recognition - at home and abroad. She has appeared on national and international television, and spoken of her dream of a future Pakistan where education would prevail.\nEven by the standards of blood-soaked Pakistan, there has been shock at the shooting. It has been condemned by Pakistan's Prime Minister, Raja Pervez Ashraf, who sent a helicopter to transfer Malala to hospital in Peshawar.\nThe head of Pakistan's Independent Human Rights Commission, Zohra Yusuf, said \"this tragic attack on this courageous child\" sends a very disturbing message to all those working for women and girls.\nOne report, citing local sources, says a bearded gunman stopped a car full of schoolgirls, and asked for Malala Yousafzai by name, before opening fire.\nBut a police official also told BBC Urdu that unidentified gunmen opened fire on the schoolgirls as they were about to board a van or bus.\nShe was hit in the head and, some reports say, in the neck area by  a second bullet, but is now in hospital and is reportedly out of danger.  Another girl who was with her at the time was also injured.\nMalala Yousafzai was just 11 when she was writing her diary, two years after the Taliban took over the Swat Valley, and ordered girls' schools to close.\nIn the diary, which she kept for the BBC's Urdu service under a pen name, she exposed the suffering caused by the militants as they ruled.\nShe used the pen-name Gul Makai when writing the diary. Her identity only emerged after the Taliban were driven out of Swat and she later won a national award for bravery and was also nominated for an international children's peace award.\nCorrespondents say she earned the admiration of many across Pakistan for her courage in speaking out about life under the brutal rule of Taliban militants.\nOne poignant entry reflects on the Taliban decree banning girls' education:  \"Since today was the last day of our school, we decided to play in the playground a bit longer. I am of the view that the school will one day reopen but while leaving I looked at the building as if I would not come here again.\"\nShe has since said that she wants to study law and enter politics when she grows up. \"I dreamt of a country where education would prevail,\" she said.\nThe BBC's Orla Guerin in Islamabad says that Malala Yousafzai was a public figure who didn't shy away from risks and had strong support from her parents for her activism. Indeed, her father, who is a school teacher, expressed his pride in her campaigning.\nIn a statement about the attack, Pakistani Prime Minister Raja Pervez Ashraf said: \"We have to fight the mindset that is involved in this. We have to condemn it... Malala is like my daughter, and yours too. If that mindset prevails, then whose daughter would be safe?\"\nAfter the Taliban: Swat women on changing life\nThe Taliban, under the notorious militant cleric Maulana Fazlullah, took hold of the Swat Valley in late 2007 and remained in de facto control until they were driven out by Pakistani military forces during an offensive in 2009.\nWhile in power they closed girls' schools, promulgated their extreme version of Sharia law and introduced measures such as banning the playing of music in cars.\nSince they were ejected, there have been isolated militant attacks in Swat but the region has largely remained stable and many of the thousands of people who fled during the Taliban years have returned.",

He will go south,\" one man said as his wife's eyes filled with tears.\n\"This is what happens, I cry every time I think of my son,\" she added.\nThe Israeli military, which has its vast headquarters in Tel Aviv, told the BBC that its offensive was putting Hamas, which governs Gaza, \"under great pressure\".\nHowever, spokeswoman Avital Leibovich confirmed that incursions still remained a possibility.\n\"We are getting ready for an option of ground operation. It's not decided yet but it's an option we're considering at this point,\" she said.\n\"Some troops were asked to approach specific areas surrounding the Gaza Strip. Some are already there, some are on their way.\"\nIn the southern part of Tel Aviv, journalists were shown around the emergency control room for the municipality, located in an underground shelter.\nIt is set up like a military command centre with maps on the walls and a long table positioned in front of projector screens and televisions.

    "His correspondents included David Lloyd George, William Gladstone, Rudyard Kipling, George Bernard Shaw and Arthur Conan Doyle.\nAnd on his death 100 years ago, obituaries were effusive in their praise, calling him the last of the great Victorians.\nYou would be forgiven for the name Charles Darwin popping into your head - but you would be wrong.\nThe theory of evolution by natural selection was published jointly between Darwin and Monmouthshire-born Alfred Russel Wallace, whose interest in natural history developed when he moved to Neath and worked as a land surveyor with his brother.\nBut while today Darwin is a household name synonymous with the theory, Wallace struggles to gain anywhere near the recognition of his friend.\nThis is illustrated by an appeal this year to raise funds for a life-sized bronze statue to honour Wallace - it only reached half of its \u00c2\u00a350,000 target.\nWallace expert Dr George Beccaloni, who is a curator at the Natural History Museum where the statue would stand, said: \"We have enough money to pay for a torso and arms at the moment.\n\"There are hundreds of Darwin statues and busts but there's not even a bust of Wallace.\n\"There's a side-profile roundel on the wall at Westminster Abbey - not far from Darwin's grave.

It was called 'Darwinism: An Exposition of the Theory of Natural Selection with Some of Its Applications'!\nProf Costa said another factor was what became known as the \"eclipse of Darwinism\", when natural selection fell out of favour in the late 19th Century.\nBy the time it was revived in the 1930s, neither man was around and the world was a very different place.\n\"I think when this idea was resurrected in 1930 there was a new generation and they very much had Darwin on their minds,\" said Prof Costa.\n\"Wallace I think had a role in this - his book 'Darwinism' for example. He tended to downplay his role in public forums and that just didn't serve him well.\n\"When it [natural selection] was resurrected, it was always associated with Darwin.\"\nHe said when evolutionary biology really took off in the 1940s, the history of the discovery had been largely forgotten.\nA Darwin \"industry\" developed and, said Prof Costa, it viewed Darwin as the \"great visionary\".\nWhile little has changed since in terms of public acclaim, there are signs that Wallace's work is gaining more recognition in certain circles.\nA series of events are being held around the world to commemorate the centenary of Wallace's death this year under the Wallace100 banner.\nThese include an exhibition in Swansea, a lecture in Berlin and a two-day conference in Malaysia.\nComedian Bill Bailey recently unveiled a restored portrait of Wallace at the Natural History Museum and has also filmed a two-part documentary for the BBC about Wallace.\nThousands of Wallace's letters have been put online for the first time, including correspondence with Darwin about evolution by natural selection.\nThere is even hope for the statue with renewed efforts being made to raise the rest of the money by August.\nBut gaining the same level of acclaim as Darwin is another matter.\n\"I think that in the popular imagination, it would be very, very difficult. It's indelibly Darwin and monkeys,\" said Prof Costa.\n\"I don't think there's much we can do about that but I do think he will emerge from relative eclipse by Darwin, certainly in the broad academic world and the world of naturalists.\n\"He contributed so much.\"",
    "Scientists have found that two types of chemicals called neonicotinoids and coumaphos are interfering with the insect's ability to learn and remember.\nExperiments revealed that exposure was also lowering brain activity, especially when the two pesticides were used in combination.\nThe research is detailed in two papers in Nature Communications and the Journal of Experimental Biology.\nBut a company that makes the substances said laboratory-based studies did not always apply to bees in the wild.\nAnd another report, published by the Defra's Food and Environment Research Agency (Fera), concluded that there was no link between bee health and exposure to neonicotinoids.\nThe government agency carried out a study looking at bumblebees living on the edges of fields treated with the chemicals.\nFalling numbers\nHoney bees around the world are facing an uncertain future.\nThey have been hit with a host of diseases, losses of habitat, and in the US the mysterious Colony Collapse Disorder has caused numbers to plummet.\nNow researchers are asking whether pesticides are also playing a role in their decline.\nTo investigate, scientists looked at two common pesticides:  neonicotinoids, which are used to control pests on oil seed rape and other crops, and a group of organophosphate chemicals called coumaphos, which are used to kill the Varroa mite, a parasite that attacks the honey bee.\nNeonicotinoids are used more commonly in Europe, while coumaphos are more often employed in the United States.\nWork carried out by the University of Dundee, in Scotland, revealed that if the pesticides were applied directly to the brains of the pollinators, they caused a loss of brain activity.\nDr Christopher Connolly said: \"We found neonicotinoids cause an immediate hyper-activation - so an epileptic type activity - this was proceeded by neuronal inactivation, where the brain goes quiet and cannot communicate any more.  The same effects occur when we used organophosphates.\n\"And if we used them together, the effect was additive, so they added to the toxicity: the effect was greater when both were present.\"\nAnother series of laboratory-based experiments, carried out at Newcastle University, examined the behaviour of the bees.\nThe researchers there found that bees exposed to both pesticides were unable to learn and then remember floral smells associated with a sweet nectar reward - a skill that is essential for bees in search of food.\nDr Sally Williamson said: \"It would imply that the bees are able to forage less effectively, they are less able to find and learn and remember and then communicate to their hive mates what the good sources of pollen and nectar are.\"\n'No threat'\nShe said that companies that are manufacturing the pesticides should take these findings into account when considering the safety of the chemicals.\nShe explained: \"At the moment, the initial tests for bee toxicity are giving the bees an acute dose and then watching them to see if they die.\n\"But because bees do these complex learning tasks, they are very social animals and they have a complex behavioural repertoire, they don't need to be killed outright in order not to be affected.\"\nThe European Commission recently called for a temporary moratorium on the use of neonicotinoids after a report by the European Food Safety Authority concluded that they posed a high acute risk to pollinators.\nBut 14 out of the 27 EU nations - including the UK and Germany - opposed the ban, and the proposal has now been delayed.\nIan Boyd, chief scientist at Defra, said: \"Decisions on the use of neonicotinoids must be based on sound scientific evidence.\"\nHe said that the results of the Fera bumblebee study suggested that the extent of the impact might not be as high as some studies had suggested - and called for \"further data based on more realistic field trials is required\".\nDr Julian Little, communications and government affairs manager at Bayer Crop Science Limited, which makes some of the pesticides, said the findings of laboratory-based studies should not be automatically extrapolated to the field.\n\"If you take an insecticide and you give it directly to an insect, I can guarantee that you will have an effect - I am not at all surprised that this is what you will see,\" he explained.\n\"What is really important is seeing what happens in real situations - in real fields, in real bee colonies, in real bee hives, with real bee keepers.\"",

    "The \u00a3127m, four-year arts programme began in 2008 and climaxed with the London 2012 Festival last summer.\nThe festival included a nationwide bell-ringing event, a bouncy Stonehenge and a string quartet in helicopters.\nBy September 2012, the report said, 29% of the UK population was aware of the Olympiad and the festival.\nThis figure rose to over 40% in London, it continued, adding the four years were believed to have seen 37.4 million attendances.\nThe Liverpool University study, published on Thursday, also said the Olympiad helped enhance the perception of Britain abroad.\nBut one arts expert has questioned how effectively the message about the London 2012 Festival came across.\n\"The numbers do not lie,\" said Marc Sands, the Tate's director of audiences and media.\n\"Vast swathes of the UK population and tourists visiting the UK for that incredible summer in some way experienced the London 2012 Festival.\n\"However, much as they may have enjoyed the event they were attending, my lasting impression is that they were unaware they were participating in a festival.\n\"Six months on from the end of London 2012, many people look at you blankly when you ask them about the London 2012 Festival,\" he went on.\n\"They remember the Olympics clearly, but are a little fuzzier about the cultural festival.\n\"When you ask about the cultural events that comprised the festival, they remember them well and with much affection.\n\"Therein lay the marketing dilemma, a gap for the festival's communications and a challenge that marketing should have solved.\"\nSands was commissioned by the London 2012 Festival organisers to give his personal reflection on the 12-week event.\nHis essay was published on Thursday alongside the official evaluation of the Cultural Olympiad, by the University of Liverpool's Institute of Cultural Capital.\nThe report said the size of the Olympiad audience - including participants and volunteers - was estimated at 43.4 million, with an additional 204.4 million reached through broadcasts and online viewings.\nIt said the millions of free tickets - the festival claimed 15.4 million \"free audiences or participants\" - enabled new audiences, especially young people, to attend festival events.\nResearch showed that 19% of the population and 84% of London 2012 Festival attendees believed the festival made a \"positive contribution\" to the games.\nIn his introduction to the report, Tony Hall, chair of the Cultural Olympiad Board, said festival organisers had hoped the cultural programme would be \"a game changer\".\nThe intention, he wrote in his introduction to the report, had been \"putting art at the heart of the Games themselves, showcasing UK world-class excellence with high economic stakes to play for cultural tourism and creative industries\".\n\"Communities all over the UK participated with enthusiasm, and the majority have been inspired to carry on enjoying culture and creativity,\" he continued.\nFormerly chief executive of the Royal Opera House and now director general of the BBC, Lord Hall took over the running of the Cultural Olympiad in 2009.\nHighlights of the London 2012 Festival programme included the World Shakespeare Festival, Mark Rylance's sonnets on the London Underground, and Deborah Warner's Peace Camp project, which featured encampments of glowing tents in remote coastal locations.\nThe Cultural Olympiad also included Unlimited - the largest ever commission of art by disabled and deaf artists - during the Paralympic Games.\nCulture Secretary Maria Miller described the events of the previous year as an \"enormous success\".\nSpeaking at the launch of the report at London's Barbican, she said: \"The Cultural Olympiad inspired an entire generation to really think again about how they participate in cultural events and activities.\"\nCultural Olympiad director Ruth Mackenzie said she had been to Rio - where the next Olympics will take place in 2016 - to discuss with arts organisations \"how to put culture at the heart of the games\".",
    "The huts, made of chalk and straw daub and wheat-thatched roofing, have been based on archaeological remains found at Durrington Walls, near Stonehenge.\nProject leader Luke Winter said: \"What we're trying to do is get a sense of what these buildings looked like above-ground.\"\nThe hope is to re-build the huts at Stonehenge visitor centre next year.\n\"What makes the buildings interesting is that they were dated to about the same time as the large sarsen stones were being erected at Stonehenge,\" Mr Winter said.\n\"One of the theories is that these may have housed the people that were helping with construction of that monument.\"\nInside, the project team has used a variety of different daubs, made of pig soil [dung] or chalk and straw and construction techniques that would have been used by  Neolithic people.\n\"We've been trying a completely different way of thatching a roof. Nothing is tied onto the roof, as you would in a modern thatched building but the wheat straw that we've used is knotted and then tucked into a woven framework.\n\"Often people think 4,500 years ago is a long time ago, which of course to us as modern people it is, but it's well into beginnings of agriculture.\n\"We're looking at people that were farming, keeping cows and domesticating cereal crops, and of course houses were an important thing.\"\nThe Neolithic huts will be kept for another two months and will open to the public during the two May bank holidays.",

    "New research suggests that biodiversity around the globe will be significantly impacted if temperatures rise more than 2C.\nBut the scientists say that the losses can be reduced if rapid action is taken to curb greenhouse gases.\nThe paper is published in the journal, Nature Climate Change.\nAn international team of researchers looked at the impacts of rising temperatures on nearly 50,000 common species of plants and animals.\nThey looked at both temperature and rainfall records for the habitats that these species now live in and mapped the areas that would remain suitable for them under a number of different climate change scenarios.\nThe scientists projected that if no significant efforts were made to limit greenhouse gas emissions, 2100 global temperatures would be 4C above pre-industrial levels.\nIn this model, some 34% of animal species and 57% of plants would lose more than half of their current habitat ranges.\nAccording to Dr Rachel Warren from the University of East Anglia, this would have major impacts for everyone on the planet.\n\"Our research predicts that climate change will greatly reduce the diversity of even very common species found in most parts of the world. This loss of global-scale biodiversity would significantly impoverish the biosphere and the ecosystem services it provides,\" she said.\n\"There will also be a knock-on effect for humans because these species are important for things like water and air purification, flood control, nutrient cycling, and eco-tourism.\"\nThe projected impacts on species will be felt more heavily in some parts of the world such as sub-Saharan Africa, Central America, the Amazon region and Australia.\nHowever the researchers say that if global emissions of greenhouse gases are cut rapidly then the impact on biodiversity could be significantly curbed. If global emissions reach their peak in 2016 and temperature rises are held to 2C, then losses could be cut by 60%.\n\"The good news is that our research provides new evidence of how swift action to reduce CO2 and other greenhouse gases can prevent the biodiversity loss by reducing the amount of global warming to 2C rather than 4 degrees, said Dr Warren.\n\"This would also buy time \u2013 up to four decades - for plants and animals to adapt to the remaining 2 degrees of climate change.\"",
    "The 11 imams, sheiks and religious teachers from nine countries met a Holocaust survivor and Poles whose families risked execution to save Jews from the Nazis, in the Polish capital's Nozyk Synagogue as part of the tour.\nThey have been around museums, including the recently opened Museum of the History of Polish Jews on the site of the former Jewish Ghetto in Warsaw. And they also visited the Auschwitz and Dachau concentration camps.\n\"The main aim is to get Muslims who are leaders all over the world, particularly in the Middle East, to acknowledge the reality of what happened here and to be able to teach it to the people that they lead,\" said trip organiser Rabbi Jack Bemporad, who is executive director of the US-based Center for Interreligious Understanding.\nHe was standing underneath the red brick watchtower over the main entrance to Birkenau, the largest of more than 40 camps that made up the Auschwitz complex. This was where the Nazis installed four gas chambers and crematoria to speed up the murder and disposal of people, who were mostly Jews, from across Europe.\nAuschwitz-Birkenau, set up by the Germans in Nazi-occupied Poland, is largely intact and is now a museum. Historians estimate 1.1 million people were killed there - one million of them were Jews but there were also Poles, Roma, Soviet prisoners of war and others.\n\"I think that when someone wants to deny the Holocaust or think that it is exaggerated, which many of them do and certainly many of their followers do, when they come here and see it, their experience is such that they can no longer think that,\" Rabbi Bemporad said.\nBeside the ruins of one of the gas chambers - the Germans blew them up as they retreated, in an effort to hide their crimes - the Muslim leaders paused for a moment's silence.\n\"You may read every book about the Holocaust but it's nothing like when you see this place where people were burned,\" said Mohamed Magid, president of the Islamic Society of North America.\n\"This is the building, the bricks. If they were to speak to you and I, they would tell you how many cries and screams they have heard.\"\nMr Magid, who is originally from Sudan, first visited Auschwitz-Birkenau during a trip organised for American imams in 2010. He said the experience had led him to hold an annual Seder, a Jewish ceremonial meal, at his mosque in Virginia where he invites people to listen to the story of a Holocaust survivor who was saved by a Muslim family.\n\"We go back more committed to human rights and more understanding of conflicts and how to resolve them, but also to be careful of a curriculum that teaches racism and hatred,\" he said.\nEarlier, the group had taken photos as they walked around an exhibition in the red brick barrack blocks at Auschwitz, about 2 miles (3kms) from Birkenau.\nThey made comments such as \"Can you imagine?\" and \"It's beyond comprehension\" as they saw a great pile of hair shorn from women prisoners that was used to make rudimentary textiles. They shook their heads as they saw faded children's shoes and dolls in glass cases.\nAfter they had seen just two of the 14 exhibition blocks, some of the group asked for a break and they knelt in prayer beside the camp's execution wall.\nBarakat Hasan, a Palestinian imam and director of the Center for Studies and Islamic Media in Jerusalem, said he \"didn't know many details about the Holocaust\" before the trip.\n\"I felt my heart bleeding when I was looking at all this. I was fighting back tears,\" he said through an interpreter. \"As a Palestinian living under occupation, I feel sympathy for the pain and injustice that was inflicted on the Jews,\" he added.\nMr Hasan said he did not believe there were people in the Muslim world who denied the Holocaust happened, but he said there was discussion in his community about whether the commonly quoted figure of six million Jewish victims was correct.\n\"Maybe now after seeing what I've seen, maybe the numbers are correct also,\" he said, adding that he would write articles and mention his trip on Facebook.\nAs he walked along the railway line and unloading ramp at Birkenau - where the trains hauling cattle cars crammed with Jews arrived - Ahmet Muharrem Atlig, a Turkish imam and secretary general of the Journalists and Writers Foundation in Istanbul, said he wept when he saw a photograph that showed children looking scared as they got off a train.\n\"Unfortunately the Muslim communities and congregation don't know much about the Holocaust,\" he said.\n\"Yes, we've heard something.

This fight came to him,\" he added.\n\"But I think he understands, as everyone else in the Labour Party does that a struggle of this nature, which is in essence political, is a determining struggle about the direction of the Labour Party.\n\"And I have no doubt in my mind that the direction in which Ed Miliband wants to move, which is as I said an open, modern, relevant party.\"\nThe Conservatives have said Labour must publish the Falkirk report and refuse to take any more money from the unions until an entirely new system of funding is agreed.\nThe Conservatives have also asked the Metropolitan Police to investigate claims of criminal wrongdoing in the selection of candidates at two more Labour Party branches.\nParty vice chair Bob Neill has written to Met commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe claiming there is evidence that \"merits investigation\".\nBut Unite said the Conservatives were wasting police time and in a \"disgraceful political witch-hunt\".\n\"We strenuously reject any suggestion of criminality or that we have broken Labour party rules. Using the police to score political points and diverting their attentions away from making our communities safer is obscene.\"\nAnd Billy Hayes, the general secretary of the CWU union, said the Conservatives and a \"gang of uber-Blairites\" were using the dispute to have a go at the unions.\n\"There's a problem in one contest that needs to be sorted out,\" he said. \"But I'm getting fed up learning through the papers that this or that aspect of the Labour Party's constitution is going to be reformed.\"",
    "Navalny had denied the charges, saying the trial was politically motivated.\nThe 37-year-old had been a leading campaigner against President Putin's United Russia party, and regularly blogged about corruption allegations.\nThe EU said the verdict posed \"serious questions\" about the state of Russian law. The US said it was \"deeply disappointed\".\nBefore he was handcuffed and led away, Navalny urged his supporters to continue his anti-corruption struggle, tweeting: \"Don't sit around doing nothing.\"\nNavalny has previously said he would like to stand for president one day.\nHe had recently registered his candidacy for the next mayor of Moscow, but his campaign team said that after the verdict he was withdrawing from the race, and called on his supporters to boycott the vote.\nBy Oleg BoldyrevBBC News, Kirov\nMinutes after Judge Blinov started reading from the substantial sheaf of papers, it became evident the two defendants, Alexei Navalny and Pyotr Ofitserov, were going to be found guilty.\nSeasoned observers of this trial were just about able to pick up the judge's words. Others were bewildered by the hum-like reading.\nEntering the courtroom just before the verdict reading started, both defendants were far from gloomy. \"Why sad faces?\" quipped Navalny, walking past dozens of journalists and a row of cameras.\nNavalny has long acquired the skill of tweeting and blogging while interminable financial documents were read by prosecution, defence and, now, judge.\nPublishing his fiery comments on politics, corruption and the need to unite in opposition to Vladimir Putin's regime - that's one of the many things he won't be able to do from behind bars, waiting for the sentence to be appealed against.\n'Explosion of anger'\nThe BBC's Moscow correspondent Daniel Sandford says that when the sentence was handed down, there were tears from Navalny's supporters and an explosion of anger on the social networking sites that he has used so effectively.\nAnti-Putin activist and former cabinet minister Boris Nemtsov told reporters the trial was \"completely fabricated from start to finish, and even the judge could not say what the reason for the crime was\".\nOther countries have also voiced their concern at the verdict. The US ambassador to Moscow, Michael McFaul, said: \"We are deeply disappointed in the conviction of Navalny and the apparent political motivations in this trial.\"\nA spokesperson for the EU's top foreign policy official, Catherine Ashton, said the embezzlement charges were unsubstantiated, and that Navalny's jailing posed \"serious questions as to the state of the rule of law in Russia\".\nFrench foreign ministry spokesman Philippe Lalliot added his concern, but said: \"We note that not all judicial remedies have been exhausted and that the sentence could be reviewed on appeal.\"\nNavalny's supporters in Moscow have vowed to stage protests against the verdict later on Thursday.\n'Almost inevitable'\nNavalny arrived at the courtroom in Kirov to hear the verdict after a 12-hour overnight train journey from Moscow.\nOur correspondent said Navalny smiled in a resigned manner when the almost inevitable guilty verdict came.\nHis wife, Yulia Navalnaya, said her husband knew he would get a non-suspended sentence and was mentally prepared to go to prison.\nNavalny was found guilty of heading a group that embezzled timber worth 16m rubles ($500,000; \u00c2\u00a3330,000) from the Kirovles state timber company while working as an adviser to Kirov's governor Nikita Belykh.\nThe prosecution had asked for a six-year jail sentence, but judge Sergei Blinov decided on five years, and said there were no extenuating circumstances that would warrant keeping Navalny out of prison.\nNavalny's co-accused, Pyotr Ofitserov, was also found guilty, and given a four-year jail sentence.\n\"Navalny... committed a grave crime,\" said Judge Blinov as he delivered the sentence.\nState television has only shown limited interest in the process despite Navalny's prominence, but online the trial has been followed extensively.\nMr Navalny came to public attention when he inspired mass protests against the Kremlin and President Vladimir Putin in December 2011.\nProfile: Alexei Navalny\nA thorn in Putin's side\nJudge Blinov said he found the testimony of the main prosecution witness, Vyacheslav Opalev, to be \"trustworthy and consistent''.\nNavalny insists that Mr Opalev spoke against him out of revenge, because Navalny had recommended he be fired and his company investigated for corruption.\nAfter the verdict, Navalny tweeted: \"So that's it. Don't get bored without me. Most importantly, don't sit around doing nothing. The toad won't get off the oil pipe by itself.\"\nIn his LiveJournal blog on Wednesday Navalny said: \"The current authorities are not a big, healthy fish, but rather a bloated fish or Latin American toad, which puffs itself up when it sees danger, with the help of television.\"\nIn an unusual step, the court allowed the whole trial to be broadcast live online.\nHe is now one of the key figures of the opposition - a thorn in the side of the political establishment, campaigning against the endemic corruption, our correspondent says.\nMr Navalny has also coined a phrase to describe the ruling party United Russia that has stuck in everyone's minds - \"the party of crooks and thieves\".",
    "Former Milan station chief Robert Lady had been released and had boarded a US-bound flight, said American officials.\nLady was sentenced to nine years in jail for his involvement in the 2003 abduction of the man - an Egyptian cleric - in Milan.\nThe cleric, known as Abu Omar, was allegedly flown to Egypt and tortured.\nIn 2009, Lady was convicted in absentia with 22 other Americans for their role in his \"extraordinary rendition\".\nHe was reportedly arrested on Wednesday near Panama's border with Costa Rica.\nAccording to Italian media reports, an international search warrant for Lady was sought by the justice minister in Italy's previous government in December 2012.\nThe Milan trial was the first involving extraordinary rendition, the CIA's practice of transferring suspects to countries where torture is permitted.\nThe practice has been condemned by human rights groups as a violation of international agreements.\nHassan Mustafa Osama Nasr, also known as Abu Omar, was considered a terrorism suspect by the US.\nHe was abducted on a Milan street in February 2003 and transferred between US military bases in Italy and Germany before being brought to Egypt.\nTwenty-two CIA agents, including Lady and an air force pilot, were convicted in 2009 of abducting the cleric. Their sentences were upheld last year by Italy's highest appeals court.\nThree more Americans, including CIA Rome station chief Jeffrey Castelli, were convicted by an appeals court in February.\nNone of the 26 convicted has ever appeared in an Italian court, and only two have had any contact with their lawyers.\nLady reportedly rushed back to the US in 2007, when court hearings began in Milan to decide whether to put the 23 Americans on trial.\nHe said he had opposed the proposal to kidnap the imam, but was overruled.\nItaly had previously said Lady was the only one of the 23 Americans that could be extradited, given the length of his sentence.",
    "The first earthquake near Dingxi city had a magnitude of 5.98 and was shallow, with a depth of just 9.8 km (6 miles), the US Geological Survey said.\nJust over an hour later, a magnitude 5.6 quake hit the same area, it added.\nIn 2008, an earthquake in Sichuan province left up to 90,000 people dead and millions homeless.\nA factory worker in Minxian county told AFP that he felt \"violent shaking\" and \"ran to the yard of the [factory] plant immediately\".\n\"Our factory is only one floor. When I came to the yard, I saw an 18-storey building, the tallest in our county, shaking ferociously, especially the 18th floor,\" he said.\nThe area has been hit by 371 aftershocks, according to the Earthquake Administration of Gansu province.\nTremors were felt in the provincial capital, Lanzhou, and as far away as Xian, 400km (250 miles) to the east.\nAt least 5,600 houses in the province's Zhangxian county are seriously damaged and 380 have collapsed, while some areas suffered from power cuts or mobile communications being disrupted, the earthquake administration added.\n\"Many have been injured by collapsed houses,\" a doctor based in Minxian county was quoted by Reuters news agency as saying. \"Many villagers have gone to local hospitals along the roads.\"\nThe earthquake has caused a direct economic loss of 198 million yuan ($32m; \u00c2\u00a321m), the Dingxi government said on its microblog.\nBoth the Chinese President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang had called Gansu province to express their concern for the victims and stress the importance of the rescue operations being conducted well, the Dingxi government added.\nCrews of fire fighters and rescue dogs have already arrived at the scene, the BBC's Celia Hatton in Beijing reports.\nIn pictures: Quakes aftermath\nThe closer to the surface an earthquake strikes, the more damage it can cause, our correspondent adds.\nThe earthquake reportedly triggered a series of mudslides and landslides, making it difficult for rescuers to access some areas hit by the quake.\nThe Gansu military police have deployed 500 soldiers, including 120 specialist rescuers, while 500 emergency tents and 2,000 quilts are also being transported to affected areas, Xinhua added.\nOfficials from the civil affairs, transportation and earthquake departments were also visiting local towns to assess the damage, a statement on the Dingxi party website said.\nRain is expected in the region later, leading to fears that this will make rescue efforts more difficult, or cause more landslides.\n\"Showery weather is expected tomorrow, and lighter rain the day after that. The rain may have an adverse effect on rescue efforts - please pay attention and be on guard!\" the Dingxi government wrote on its microblog.\nResidents in towns near the earthquake also reported feeling the tremors.\n\"You could see the chandeliers wobble and the windows vibrating and making noise, but there aren't any cracks in the walls,\" AP news agency quoted a clerk at Wuyang Hotel, about 40 km (25 miles) from the epicentre, as saying.\n\"Shop assistants all poured out onto the streets when the shaking began,\" the clerk said.",
    "The assessments should indicate whether chemical weapons were used and if so the agent involved.\nThe work could also reveal whether the weapons systems were improvised or designed for military use.\nThe analysis being carried out by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons under the auspices of the United Nations.\nNeither the UN nor the OPCW will comment on details of the investigation. But BBC News has spoken to a former senior employee of the OPCW, who has given his assessment of the likely details and timetable of the testing process.\nDr Ralf Trapp said that samples from Syria gathered by inspectors had arrived at the OPCW central laboratory on Saturday and would be arriving at \"designated laboratories\" across the world around now for analysis. The results will form part of a report by the OPCW due to be published by the UN on the alleged attack. He told BBC News that the report would take between seven to 10 days to complete at the earliest.\nThe report should contain strong scientific evidence to help establish whether chemical weapons were involved in the alleged attack last in the agricultural belt Ghouta around the Syrian capital Damascus. It could also possibly indicate the type of delivery systems to have been used, according to Dr Trapp.\n\"There may be details of the concentrations of the agent used and whether these weapons were improvised or designed for a military context,\" he said.\nThe purpose of the UN/OPCW report is to establish the facts of what happened rather than find the culprit. However, according to Dr Trapp, these facts should give an indication of the source. It will also help answer why, in his opinion, many of the victims did not display the typical symptoms of sarin exposure, such as the narrowing of pupils (known as pinball eyes) and shaking, in video clips uploaded shortly after the alleged attack.\n\"I'm pretty sure it was a chemical attack, but I'm not 100% sure it was sarin, or sarin of bad quality, another agent, or a mixture of things. All these things make sense in the context of what we have seen (in the videos),\" he explained.\nLast week OPCW and UN investigators were gathering soil, blood, urine and hair from the alleged victims of the attack and tissue samples from corpses. They have also been wiping possible chemical residues from the inside of shell fragments.\nThere had been concern that few, if any, traces of nerve agent would be detected following the two days it took for UN inspectors to arrive at the site of the alleged attack. But according to Dr Trapp, evidence of these agents would remain for many weeks.\nThe samples have been tagged, photographed and transported to OPCW's central laboratory in sealed containers. The testing procedures involve numerous checks and cross checks to ensure that there is no mix up in the samples and the results are accurate.\nEach sample is sent to three separate laboratories that the organisation has inspected and deemed competent to carry out the testing on its behalf. If there are many samples to analyse, they are sent to other laboratories. Individual labs conduct their own independent tests of the material.\nFor each sample from the site of the alleged attack, a given laboratory receives two dummy samples; one containing no nerve agent and another containing a specified amount of a nerve agent or its breakdown product. The lab is not told which sample is which, enabling the OPCW to ensure that each lab does its job properly.\nIn addition, a lab has to test each sample using two completely different methods - and then, as a triple check to verify the accuracy of the instruments they are using, manufacture the agent it thinks it has detected and run the test again to see if they obtain the same result.\nThis painstaking process will take the scientists several days to complete, after which the lead investigator will have to write up a report which is then sent back to the OPCW.\nThese results are combined with interviews, assessments of medical reports by inspectors.\nThe time all this will take depends on the number of samples that have to be analysed and the number of labs involved in the testing.\nDr Trapp believes that mid to late next week will be the very earliest that the UN could receive the completed report although Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon will be receiving regular updates in the interim.\nOne of the testing sites on the OPCW's list of \"designated laboratories\" is the UK's Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) at Porton Down in Wiltshire, which is internationally respected for its research capability in this area. The network of more than 20 laboratories also includes facilities in China, the US and France.\nThe laboratories undertaking the work will have been selected by the OPCW's director-general Mr Ahmet Uzumcu, no doubt in consultation with Mr Ban. The list of institutions has not been revealed but there is speculation that laboratories in countries on the UN's Security Council are not involved.\nFollow Pallab on Twitter",
    "The holders won eight straight races to triumph 9-8 after being docked two points for cheating in the build-up.\nOracle surged to victory by 44 seconds to retain the Cup they won in 2010.\nThe Kiwis won four of the first five races, making Oracle modify their boat and call Ainslie from the warm-up crew.\nThe British sailing legend, 36, a four-time Olympic champion, was drafted in as tactician in place of American veteran John Kostecki and was instrumental in the US outfit's resurgence.\n\"It's been one of the most amazing comebacks ever, I think, almost in any sport but certainly in sailing and to be a part of that is a huge privilege,\" said Ainslie.\nAinslie combined superbly with Oracle's Australian skipper James Spithill and strategist Tom Slingsby, another Australian who won Laser gold at London 2012, to drag the syndicate back from the brink in the most remarkable turnaround in the event's 162-year history.\n\"To be perfectly honest, we had a mountain to climb,\" Ainslie added. \"We knew we had to sort ourselves out. We had to get the boat going faster. We did that.\n\"The designers did a great job and we had to start sailing better. We got the momentum going and we started believing in ourselves. When you do that, you can become quite strong. \"\nThe New Zealanders, with impressive early pace upwind and slicker boat handling, opened up a seven-point lead (six to minus one) as Oracle's crew and equipment changes took effect.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nBut the US outfit, bankrolled by software billionaire Larry Ellison, were soon up to speed and won 10 of the next 12 races to lift the oldest trophy in international sport, known affectionately as the \"Auld Mug\".\nThe Kiwis, led by skipper Dean Barker, came within two minutes of glory in race 13 in uncharacteristic light winds before organisers abandoned the race because the 40-minute time limit had elapsed.\nIn the decider in fresh breeze and sunshine on San Francisco Bay, Team New Zealand edged a tight start and beat Oracle to the first mark. The Kiwis stayed clear around the second mark but lost the lead to the Americans early on the upwind leg.\nAfter briefly retaking the advantage, the Kiwis then watched as Oracle stormed ahead with remarkable upwind pace and remained clear for a comfortable win.\nI'm incredibly proud of our team and what they've achieved but I'm gutted we didn't get the last win we needed\n\"What a race,\" said Spithill, 34, after only the third winner-takes-all final in the event's history. \"It had everything. Man, these guys just showed so much heart.\n\"On your own, you're nothing, but a team like this can make you look great. We were facing the barrel of a gun at 8-1 and the guys didn't even flinch. Thanks to San Francisco, this is one hell of a day.\"\nBarker, 41, said: \"It's obviously very hard to fathom. We went out there to give it our absolute best shot. We felt we didn't leave anything on the table. It's very hard to swallow. The gains they've made are phenomenal.\n\"I'm incredibly proud of our team and what they've achieved, but I'm gutted we didn't get the last win we needed to take the Cup back to New Zealand.\"\nAs winners, Oracle will decide on the format, venue and timing of the 35th America's Cup.\nThe US syndicate first won the Cup in 2010, when they beat holders Alinghi of Switzerland in a one-off match in huge multihulls following protracted legal wrangling.\nEllison and Oracle Team USA boss Russell Coutts, who won the Cup for New Zealand in 1995 and 2000 before defecting to Alinghi for 2003, devised a new concept for the 2013 competition.\nThey opted for revolutionary 72ft catamarans with rigid wing sails - and foiling daggerboards later pioneered by the Kiwis - which allowed the boats to reach startling speeds of more than 50mph.\nRaces were brought inshore to make it more accessible for fans, while cutting-edge TV production with on-screen graphics were introduced to make it more appealing for a new audience of TV viewers.\nBut the format was controversial and designs untested, with critics fearing for the safety of sailors.\nOracle capsized last year, but it was the death of British Olympian Andrew Simpson in a training accident in May that prompted wide-ranging safety measures, including upper wind-speed limits and personal breathing apparatus.\nCritics also pointed to spiralling costs, with only three teams - Artemis Racing of Sweden, Emirates Team New Zealand and Luna Rossa Challenge of Italy - emerging to compete in the Louis Vuitton Cup challenger series for the right to take on Oracle.\nArtemis were unable to mount a meaningful campaign after Simpson's death, as Team New Zealand outclassed Luna Rossa in a one-sided Louis Vuitton Cup final.\nBut despite Team New Zealand's early stranglehold and a number of races postponed because of unfavourable winds, the America's Cup showed that match-racing in giant catamarans can be hugely exciting and is likely to be the future of the event.",
    "These were the first mid-air attacks by fighter jets since a bill authorising such action against illegal planes was approved earlier this month, the Bolivarian Armed Forces said.\nThe aircraft were allegedly smuggling drugs from Central America and refused to follow the military pilots' orders.\nAnother 11 unauthorised planes have been disabled on the ground this year.\nVenezuelan security forces say more than 35 tonnes of drugs have been found this year.\nThe head of Venezuela's Strategic Operational Centre, General Vladimir Padrino Lopez, told the country's state television that a plane had been targeted after \"all other means of persuasion had been exhausted\" in the early hours of Saturday.\n\"This was the first plane shot mid-air in the country since the approval of the Law and Control Regulation for the Integral Defence of the National Airspace, following the orders of our commander-in-chief, President Nicolas Maduro,\" Gen Padrino said.\nAnother plane allegedly tried to evade the authorities by trying to land on an illegal airstrip in the jungle and was also shot down.\n\"These are drug trafficking mafias which intend to use our country as a platform for drug distribution, trespassing our airspace,\" the head of the National Anti-Drugs Agency, Alejandro Keleris Bucarito said, after posting a photo of the destroyed plane on Twitter.\nThe two incidents suggest the Venezuelan government is stepping up its efforts to prevent drug-trafficking flights over its airspace, particularly since President Maduro issued a public warning to drug smugglers, the BBC's Will Grant says.\nAfter the approval of the airspace bill, earlier in October, Mr Maduro threatened \"international narco-traffickers\".\n\"Any plane entering Venezuela is going to be obliged to land in peace. If not, it will be brought down by our Sukhoi jets, our F-16s and by all of the Venezuelan military aviation,\" he said.\nDuring the late President Hugo Chavez's period in power, the US Drug Enforcement Administration was expelled from the country provoking criticism from Washington that the Venezuelan authorities weren't doing enough to tackle drug cartels operating in the country.",

    "The former striker, still remarkably fresh faced for 40, is now attempting to make an impact as a Premier League manager at Cardiff City, having spent three seasons in his native Norway in charge of Molde.\nOne of the biggest things he did was make the players feel more confident. It wasn't magic - it was paying attention to the details\nHis spell there brought two top-flight titles, the first in Molde's history, as well as a Norwegian Cup as he quickly established a reputation as a promising young manager.\nThose who know Solskjaer describe him as mild mannered and gentle, with a knack for getting the best out of players and a desire to play attacking football. They also call him tough-minded and ambitious.\nBut how will a manager used to \"complete control\" of team affairs fare in one of Europe's most unforgiving leagues and under one of the Premier League's more controversial owners in Malaysian businessman Vincent Tan?\n\"He showed he is a good manager in the short time he was here at Molde,\" says the club's Norway international goalkeeper Espen Bugge Pettersen. \"There is no reason why he should not be successful.\n\"He probably has not changed a lot since his playing days. He is a mild and gentle guy but when it is needed he can put his foot down.\n\"You won't find anyone who has a bad word to say about him, because they don't exist. He isn't afraid of making the tough decisions but he does it the right way and if he is not satisfied he will let you know.\"\nSolskjaer, scorer of Manchester United's injury-time winner in their 1999 Champions League final triumph over Bayern Munich, ended his 11-year playing career at Old Trafford with six Premier League titles and two FA Cups to add to that Champions League winners' medal.\nInjuries disrupted his final few years as a player and he was then offered a coaching role at the club by Sir Alex Ferguson, where as reserve team boss he won the Manchester Senior Cup, the Lancashire Senior Cup and the Premier League reserve play-offs.\n\"Ole always wanted to stay in the game, so from an early age he was preparing to stay in the game as a coach or as a manager,\" Ferguson told the Manchester Evening News in 2012.\n\"He was always one of the professionals who used to take down all the notes from the training sessions and games. He has got an inner toughness, there's no doubt about that.\"\nGiven his first senior managerial role at Molde in 2011, Solskjaer delivered instant success at the club from which Manchester United had signed him in 1996.\nA first Tippeligaen title in the club's 100-year history arrived in his first season, breaking the dominance of Rosenberg, who had won 16 of the previous 19 championships, followed by a successful title defence and then the Norwegian Cup in November.\n\"Molde is a small place with 25,000 to 30,000 people,\" says Jonas Bergh-Johnsen, a journalist for Norwegian TV channel TV2. \"It is small club and he won the league at his first attempt and I think it surprised him.\n\"They say the most difficult thing is to recreate success but he did. It was a magnificent achievement, massive for the town and for the club. He was a hero before but now he is a legend.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\n\"There wasn't loads of money to spend at Molde but he got together a very good group of young players who wanted to play for him. A lot of his success has come from developing young players.\"\nLike Ferguson, Bergh-Johnsen marks out the young manager for his \"mental toughness\".\n\"At the start of last season, things were not going well and he was getting a lot of criticism,\" he adds \"This was a new thing for him but he dug deep and turned things round.\"\nSolskjaer's playing career, which included 67 caps for Norway, earned him instant respect when he arrived as manager at Molde but those who played under him insist he brought far more than just his reputation.\n\"He is a legend in Norway, in football, and he brought that aura with him,\" says keeper Petterson. \"He was able to get that little bit extra out of the players\n\"When he came, the club was good and the squad was good. The year before, we came second so the platform was already there.\n\"But one of the biggest things he did was make the players feel a little bit more confident. He made us all feel special and wanted. It wasn't magic, it was by paying attention to the fine details.\n\"He changed a lot around the place. He put pictures up around the ground, like they have at Old Trafford, and brought a lot of what he learned at Manchester United to Molde.\n\"He wants his teams to play attacking football but he also insists on hard work. I am sure he will stick with that philosophy in the Premier League.\"\nCardiff are not the first Premier League club to have been tempted by Solskjaer's early managerial promise.\nHe held talks with Aston Villa owner Randy Lerner in May 2012 following the sacking of Alex McLeish but decided to remain with Molde because he was reluctant to uproot his family from Norway.\nHe was also a candidate to replace Steve Kean at Blackburn Rovers in the Championship last season after the Scot's troubled relationship with controversial owners Venky's finally came to an end.\nSome in Norway are surprised he has now opted to make his Premier League managerial debut under Bluebirds owner Tan.\nBut it is not as simple as that, according to former Norway and Middlesbrough striker Jan Aage Fjortoft, now a football pundit.\n\"It has always been said that a manager has to find the right owner,\" says Fjortoft. \"If you believe everything you read about Tan, you would think 'any owner but him'.\n\"Ole has seen something at the club, though, and has seen this is a big chance.\n\"At Molde, he did have full control and was completely hands on, so wherever he went it would be a challenge because he would not get that control he has been used to.\"\nNot everything will be unfamiliar in his new environment, however. Solskjaer will take former Manchester United and Sheffield United midfielder Mark Dempsey, his assistant at Molde, with him to south Wales.\nSolskjaer's former Norway team-mate Morten Gamst Pedersen, who spent nine years at Blackburn, believes the duo work well together.\n\"It is always an advantage if you can come in with people you know,\" says Pedersen. \"I know Mark well as I used to train at Tromso sometimes where he was coach. He is a very good coach.\n\"There is no getting away from the fact Ole is a very nice guy. I remember he wished me luck by text when I joined Blackburn but there is no reason you can't be nice and succeed.\n\"He has never had lots of money to spend before so it will be interesting to see how he copes with that. He knows the English game, though, and is a very clever guy, so I think he will deal with it all well.\"\nSolskjaer's new Premier League adventure begins with a home match against Newcastle United in the FA Cup, before Premier League trips to former employers Manchester United and their local rivals Manchester City later this month.\n\"The best word to describe him is adjustable,\" says Fjortoft. \"He wants to play football and wants to play the ball from the back, with speed and young kids, like he did at Molde.\n\"But he won't be naive. He will be ready to fit around what best suits the match and the players.

    "He said new forests would slow flooding by trapping water with their roots.\nThe idea of \"rewilding\" the uplands is catching on fast as parts of Britain face repeated flooding, with more rainfall on the way.\nEnvironment Secretary Owen Paterson said he would seriously consider innovative solutions like rewilding.\nThe government has been criticised for being slow to capitalise on the benefits of capturing rain where it falls.\nLord Rooker, a Labour peer, said too much emphasis had been attached to the look of the countryside rather than practical considerations like trapping water.\n\"We pay the farmers to grub up the trees and hedges; we pay them to plant the hills with pretty grass and sheep to maintain the chocolate box image, and then wonder why we've got floods,\" he said.\nThe idea of reintroducing forests into catchments has been strongly supported by several leading scientists.\nThe government is sponsoring a handful of catchment trials to assess the potential of the upstream areas to catch water and send it slowly downhill.\nA research paper for the Environment Agency shows that some of the schemes, like partly damming streams with felled trees to cause local flooding, are highly unpredictable when employed on their own.\nIf they divert rainfall on to surrounding fields that can actually make flooding downstream worse if the water then flows off the fields, bypassing bends in the river.\nBut the study, which is not yet peer-reviewed, suggests that reintroducing flood forests to upland areas can be highly effective - and potentially much cheaper than conventional flood defences.\nThe author, Simon Dixon, said: \"Complex forested floodplains dramatically slow water moving over them as they have an irregular surface covered by tree roots, upright tree trunks and dead wood.\"\nHe explains the process this way: \"As a simple analogy during a flood many 'packets' of water are delivered to the main trunk river from all its tributaries.\n\"If the delivery of a single large 'packet' of water can be significantly delayed it will then arrive at the main river after the peak of the flood, and thus the main flood peak height has less 'packets' of water in it and is lower.\"\nThe best results come, he says, when rivers are partly dammed and a forest is allowed to grow on the floodplain. \"This shows substantial and predictable responses in downstream flood height,\" he said.\nThis is exactly what would have happened if farmers had not been encouraged by government to maximise food production by felling forests to graze sheep on the uplands.\nLord Rooker got the idea of reintroducing forests from an article by the green journalist George Monbiot, who complained that farmers are subsidised to keep sheep even though the grazing animals actually make flooding worse by compacting the earth.\n\"Instead of a steady flow sustained around the year by trees in the hills, by sensitive farming methods, by rivers which are allowed to find their own course and their own level, to filter and hold back their waters through bends and braiding and obstructions, we get a cycle of flood and drought. We get filthy water and empty aquifers and huge insurance premiums and ruined carpets. And all of it at public expense,\" Mr Monbiot wrote earlier this month.\nThe idea of catching water upstream is strongly supported by the water and environment professional body, the Chartered Institution of Water and Environmental Management (CIWEM).\nIts spokesman Katherine Pygott has previously told BBC News: \"Flooding is getting worse with changing weather patterns, but these schemes are taking a very long time and a lot of energy.\n\"Projects working with nature to reduce flood risk are needed right across the country - but it is complicated, with many different organisations involved, and it will need political leadership from the highest level to make it happen. So far we haven't seen that leadership.\"\nEnvironment Secretary Owen Paterson told me he would give serious consideration to innovative solutions to flooding, like rewilding.\nThe government could theoretically encourage farmers to rewild key parts of their catchments using grants under the Common Agricultural Policy, but CIWEM say that at the moment it is much easier for farmers to get grants for wildlife protection than flood protection.\nMr Paterson had hoped to divert more cash into a fund that could be used for these sort of measures but was overruled by the prime minister after a campaign by farmers demanding to keep the maximum amount of their grants into direct payments for farming - in effect, for owning land.\nFollow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin",
    "The proposal, from the right-wing Swiss People's Party, calls on Switzerland to abandon its free movement of people treaty with the European Union and introduce strict quotas on immigration.\nSwitzerland is not a member of the EU, but has adopted large sections of EU policy, including free movement and the Schengen open-borders agreement, in order to have access to Europe's single market.\nBrussels has always insisted that the Swiss will not be allowed to cherry-pick only the aspects of EU policy they like.\nBut its successful economy, and soaring unemployment in many eurozone countries, make Switzerland a very attractive destination.\nIn 2013, 80,000 immigrants joined Switzerland's population of eight million. To put that in perspective, that would be the equivalent of more than 600,000 people entering the United Kingdom, or more than 800,000 arriving in Germany.\n\"It's getting too crowded,\" says farmer Martin Haab. \"On the roads, on the trains, especially in the cities.\"\nMr Haab's farm is just outside Zurich, sandwiched between a busy railway line and an even busier motorway.\n\"I worry for my son,\" he explains, \"and for my grandchildren. If we have 80,000 people a year\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 that means in 20 years, 10 million in Switzerland; in 40 years 12 or 13 million - that means the whole of north-west Switzerland will be one big city in the end.\"\nBut while Mr Haab has genuine fears about overcrowding, he is also a local politician with the Swiss People's Party, and shares its hostility to the European Union, and its determination to crack down on immigration.\nHe would like Switzerland to return to its earlier policy of hiring foreign workers on a temporary or seasonal basis, requiring them to come to Switzerland alone and to return home as soon the specific job they came to do is finished.\n\"With free movement now, we know that only 50% of the immigrants work here,\" he explains. \"The rest are just families.\"\nBut Mr Haab's view is not shared by many Swiss employers, who claim their success is actually because of, rather than despite, free movement.\nStephan Camenzind is director of one of Zurich's most successful architect firms, with orders including a contract to design Google's offices right across Europe.\nOf his 20 employees, just a third are Swiss, the rest are from the European Union.\n\"We depend on a highly skilled workforce,\" he explains. \"And that workforce we simply can't find in Switzerland, so we do depend on being able to look for talented staff in the European Union.\"\nSo what would happen if his freedom to do that was restricted by quotas?\n\"Well it's quite simple,\" he says. \"We would have to shrink. We would lose our critical mass to compete globally, so basically there wouldn't be a business anymore.\"\nThat is a worrying thought for his German employee Claudia Berkefeld, who has worked in the UK as well as Switzerland, and relishes the opportunities offered by free movement of people.\n\"It concerns me in the sense that being able to move around freely and work in Europe [is important], I would find it very limiting if you couldn't do that.\"\nEU workers in Switzerland are not the only ones worrying about the consequences of a no vote to free movement of people. Swiss business leaders are anxious too.\nJens Atteslander, an economist with the Swiss Business Federation, points out that Brussels has made it very clear that although Switzerland is not in the EU, it cannot simply abandon aspects of EU policy which are unpopular with its citizens, such as free movement, and keep the popular ones, such as access to Europe's single market.\n\"Integration into the single market is absolutely crucial to our economy,\" he explains. \"Over 55% of all our exports go directly to the European single market. We import over 80% from that market.\n\"We got very clear statements from Brussels. They tell us: 'Listen, this is the fundamental principle of the single market, those who do not comply with it do not have access or integration into the single market.' We are here in a closed neighbourhood, we are in the heart of western Europe, so there is no alternative.\"\nThe latest opinion polls show the referendum on free movement is likely to be very close. Despite the very real economic concerns, despite the fact that unemployment in Switzerland is just 3% and that sectors such as the health service (over a third of staff in Swiss hospitals are foreign) depend on workers from the EU, many voters are swayed by the argument that Switzerland just cannot take any more people.\nA yes to free movement will mean an open door to EU workers.\nA yes to quotas could have potentially disastrous consequences for the Swiss economy. But it will also be a signal to Brussels that at least one European country wants to opt out of one the EU's most cherished policies.\nWhichever way the vote goes, the result will have big implications, for Switzerland and for Europe.",

    "British sliders have won medals at all six Olympics in which the sport has featured, and in Yarnold and Amy Williams, Team GB can boast back-to-back Olympic champions.\nYarnold is also the World Cup champion and team-mate Shelley Rudman the reigning world champion. Rudman's Olympic silver medal at Turin in 2006 and Alex Coomber's breakthrough bronze in 2002 add to the medal haul, plus world championship and World Cup titles for Kristan Bromley in the men's event.\nSo just how does Britain, without its own track, rule the skeleton scene?\nThe sport evolved in the Swiss resort of St Moritz in the late 19th century when wealthy British tourists took to cavorting around town on sleds, looking apparently, like skeletons. The sport featured in the 1928 and 1948 Olympics, with Britain bagging bronze both times, before sitting out the next 54 years. It was reinstated for Salt Lake City in 2002, when a 29-year-old female Royal Air Force officer named Coomber kick-started a rich heritage.\n\"Prior to 2000, skeleton was a sport done by the Army, Navy and Air Force for recreation, and that was probably the only route into the sport,\" explained British Skeleton's first performance director Simon Timson, who is now performance director at UK Sport.\n\"Somebody asked BAE Systems to build a sled and they assigned a PhD student to it. He was called Kristan Bromley. None of the soldiers would try Kristan's sled, so the only way he could test it was to ride it himself, so that's how he got into the sport.\n\"Kristan produced a bullet of a sled in the late 1990s and that led to him and Alex Coomber becoming overall World Cup champions in 1999. The sport gained Olympic status later that year and UK Sport invested National Lottery funds.\n\"We really got through to 2002 on Kristan producing the world's best sled, and the pure luck that probably the most natural slider ever to do the sport, Alex Coomber, had fallen into it through the RAF. Alex's bronze medal secured the funding and then we began to really systematise the sport.\n\"We put a very simple plan in place: to identify athletes with the potential to be the fastest starters in the world, put them on the ice every day - because there used to be a big sliding deficit to the other nations - employ the world's best coaches, and put them on cutting-edge equipment. Really for the last 14 years, all the sport has done is ruthlessly and relentlessly pursue that formula.\"\nSimon Timson: \"If you live in Koenigsee in deepest Bavaria, your Wednesday afternoon PE lesson from age six is luge. It's a finer, more difficult skill to master and takes a lot longer. You can't actually start bobsleigh or skeleton until you are 16, legally.\n\"So even if we don't start athletes like Amy Williams until they are 19 or 20, we don't have that same deficit in practice to make up that we have in luge, because realistically, how many British six-year-olds are going to be on a luge track every week?\"\nBritain does not have its own ice track but does have an impressive 140m push-start facility at the University of Bath.\nThe track, built in 2001, features wheeled sleds running on rails, and allows athletes to work on their sprint starts all year round. Around the world there are tracks in Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Austria, France, Norway, Japan, Canada and the United States of America. The British team mainly uses the Igls track in Austria as a base.\nTimson: \"For developing athletes, we aim for a minimum of 60 runs a year on ice, which doubles to 120 in year two. From then on we're chasing the magic figure of 120-150 runs a year, which is comparable to all the other countries. You're pulling five Gs [five times the force of gravity] so it might only be a minute's run, but it is incredibly attritional on the body. There is a limit to what you can do in a day.\"\nTraining, travel, talent identification, research and development, administration  and staffing costs all come out of the UK Sport grant, plus private sponsorship.\nBritish Skeleton received \u00a32.1m of National Lottery and Exchequer investment from UK Sport for the four-year cycle leading up to Vancouver.\nWilliams's gold medal saw this rise to \u00a33.4m for Sochi, making skeleton the most funded British winter sport.\n\"We knew someone had to win a medal in Vancouver or the sport wouldn't have received funding,\" said Williams. \"That gold medal allowed this funding for Lizzy's programme to exist. That's the brutal side of it.\"\nTimson's initial talent identification programme in summer 2002 picked out six aspiring athletes. They included Williams, Rudman, Greg Kirk, who won the world junior championships in 2004, and Adam Pengilly, who was a silver medallist at the World Championships in 2009 and is now an International Olympic Committee member.\nAnother talent campaign by UK Sport and the English Institute of Sport in 2008 called Girls4Gold spotted Yarnold, a county-level heptathlete. Four years later, she was the junior world champion and is now the Olympic champion.\nA new scheme called Power2Podium for potential male and female sliders between 17 and 25 was launched in 2011 and will open again after Sochi.\n\"Power, speed, explosiveness out of the blocks,\" said Williams, a talented sprinter at the University of Bath.. \"A fast push is so important - one-tenth of a second at the top could be two at the bottom.\n\"You are in the gym doing strength sessions every day to get that power off the block.\n1924: Men (curling)\n1936: Men (ice hockey)\n1952: Jeannette Altwegg (figure skating)\n1964: Tony Nash & Robin Dixon (two-man bobsleigh)\n1976: John Curry (figure skating)\n1980: Robin Cousins (figure skating)\n1984: Jayne Torvill & Christopher Dean (figure skating)\n2002: Women (curling)\n2010: Amy Williams (skeleton)\n2014: Lizzy Yarnold (skeleton)\n* Madge Syers won figure skating gold at the 1908 Summer Olympics in London\n\"Your head is also pushed into the ice by the G-force, so you have to have a very strong neck. You do similar things to rugby players in regards to strengthening the neck in training.\n\"The new breed of girls coming through are bigger and heavier than they have been in the past. Lizzy fits that profile perfectly.\n\"Plus, having the mindset and psychology of an athlete, being able to lie on that sled and be calm under pressure and react quickly to mistakes, not in five corners' time.\"\nBut as well as athletic ability, the selectors were looking for drive.\nWilliams explained: \"For me, every decision, every single day was, 'Will this help me win gold, yes or no?' Is this ice cream going to help me? No? Then don't eat it. It was as brutal as that.\n\"It's all those little tiny decisions that give you confidence and all affect your performance. If you can perfect every part of your training in the summer when you are not on the track, it all mounts up.\"\nYarnold added: \"Gold medal winners are made in the gym by getting there first and leaving last and you complete every rep to the best of your ability. That's what I have learnt from Amy - that normal girls can become champions. You just have to put in the effort, the time and the dedication.\"\nSled technology, as well as that for helmets and suits, is an ongoing quest for speed and better aerodynamics. Within certain boundaries, anything goes.\nBromley was nicknamed \"Dr Ice\" after earning his PhD from the University of Nottingham with a thesis entitled \"Factors affecting the performance of skeleton bobsleds\".\nBromley's early prototypes sparked the ongoing success of British skeleton, and he and Rudman still race on sleds designed and produced with his brother Richard by their company, Bromley Technologies Ltd.\nUK Sport also has technology partnerships with BAE Systems and McLaren, of Formula 1 fame, who work with a number of British sports, including skeleton, cycling, sailing, rowing and canoeing, to provide cutting-edge research, design and engineering.\nThere is a big science behind this sport - it is not simply lying down on a sled.\n\"Williams's sled, which she called \"Arthur  and was designed by engineering post-graduates at the University of Southampton, was a product of this programme, as is Yarnold's sled \"Mervyn\", named after one of her early sponsors.\nA sled costs up to about \u00a315,000, but with the technology and research and development that goes into each GB sled the figure rises to \u00a3100,000.\n\"There is so much that goes into the skeleton that nobody sees,\" said Williams. \"From the technology, to the runners on the sled, to the hours in the wind tunnel to perfect your aerodynamic positioning.\n\"Even before the race you are sewing up everything so nothing on your suit is flapping in the wind and causing drag. I could talk about all the details for hours.\n\"There is a big science behind this sport - it is not simply lying down on a sled.\n\"When I started, no-one taught me the science - the corners, the pressures, what the sled does, I had to figure it out. Now they get instruction straight away and the learning curve is massive.\"\nIn line with British Skeleton's early ethos to secure the best coaches, they landed Andi Schmid, an Austrian luger and former world skeleton champion. The 52-year-old from Innsbruck is supported by a team of world-class coaches and support staff.\n\"Starting from the very beginning, 12 years ago, there was nothing - just good ideas and strong people, but we had to start from scratch,\" said Schmid, who has had stints as both head coach and performance director.\n\"Because we don't have our own track, we have to be really strong in understanding how we coach and how we identify the right athletes.\"\nWilliams added: \"It's really important to have coaches and athletes who are on that same wavelength. Lizzy and Andi have got a winning formula, like I did four years ago. The way they talk about her lines, the tracks and the steers, they've gone from strength to strength.\"",

    "Iain Duncan Smith said the raft of changes should save the taxpayer \u00c2\u00a350bn by the end of this Parliament.\nHe said the reforms - including tougher criteria for people seeking disability allowances - would \"help and benefit\" those who wanted to return to work.\nThe Disabilities Trust charity said the reforms were part of a \"triple whammy\" of factors hitting disabled people.\nSpeaking on BBC One's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Duncan Smith said: \"I think the work programme is now for the first time ever working with people, who were once on sickness benefits and who are now not, going back to work.\"\nHe said the new regime would see disabled benefits claimants assessed on a regular basis to determine whether they need more support with their ailments or help to get work.\n\"There were over a million [people] not looked at for over 10 years,\" Mr Duncan Smith said.\n\"These regular reviews, I think, will help them and benefit them. We haven't introduced this to hurt or to harm disabled people. The purpose is to try to support disabled people.\"\nHe added: \"The idea is to get people assessed so that we can find out those whose conditions have improved can then seek work, and many are going back to work now, and those who need full support get that full support.\"\nThe government has been gradually rolling out the new Personal Independence Payment (Pip) to replace the Disability Living Allowance (DLA).\nUnder the old disability regime, claimants had to prove they could walk no further than 50m without support to receive the top end of the allowance.\nNow, they will have to prove they can manage no more than 20m to benefit from the top payment.\nMr Duncan Smith insisted this was not a straight forward change, and that people would be assessed in two stages - on how much difficulty they have in reaching 20m first, and then 50m.\n\"What we're trying to do with these reforms is to get them to be fair so that the people who need them get better payments, and those who don't need the higher levels don't take the higher levels,\" Mr Duncan Smith said.\nUnder the DLA system, he said, 70% of people who made a claim got awards \"for life\".\nThe new regime will include regular face-to-face checks to establish the extent of claimants' ailments.\nHe said the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) expects almost half of the \u00c2\u00a350bn in savings to come in the next 12 months.\nThe raft of welfare reforms, introduced a year ago, also included what the government calls the removal of the \"spare room subsidy\" but critics call the \"bedroom tax\".\nMr Duncan Smith, defending it, said it was not a tax but rather a \"balanced and fair\" policy for taxpayers.\nHowever, Sarah Clifford, director of communications for the Disabilities Trust, said the reforms were part of a \"triple whammy\" of factors affecting disabled people.\nShe said the changes needed to be seen alongside cutbacks by local authorities and changes to housing benefit in England, Scotland and Wales.\nThe housing benefits changes - dubbed the \"bedroom tax\" by critics but described by ministers as the removal of a \"spare room subsidy\" - were introduced in April last year.  A committee of MPs warned last week that the measures were creating \"financial hardship and distress\" for disabled people.\nMs Clifford said: \"We just hope Mr Duncan Smith can deliver on the promise that this will be a fair system and will not be unfair or unjust on people with disabilities.\"\nMeanwhile, the work and pensions secretary said the government had sought to end a contract with the firm Atos, which was tasked with assessing whether benefit claimants were fit to work.\nMr Duncan Smith denied reports it was Atos that had ended the arrangement, saying the taxpayer would pay nothing for the early break in the contract.",
    "That is a harsh reflection on his playing career, though, because Simeone was a magnificent midfielder, winning 106 international caps and starring in Serie A for Inter Milan and Lazio as well as guiding Atletico to a league and cup double in 1996 (their most recent La Liga triumph).\nAnd now, Simeone is carving a new career as one of the game's hottest managerial properties, with his approach to coaching mirroring the blend of winning attitude and technical aptitude that characterised his playing days.\nIf you asked Diego Simeone how his Atletico Madrid team have overcome all the odds to progress to the Champions League semi-finals, where they will face Jose Mourinho's Chelsea, as well as topping La Liga with just six games remaining, he would provide you with a simple answer: \"Hard work and humility.\"\nIndeed, that is exactly the mantra he has been preaching on a weekly basis this season, as the football world continues to wonder when - or if at all - his steamroller of a team will finally run out of puff.\nUntil recently, most people assumed it would simply be a matter of time. When, not if. But Wednesday's famous victory over Barcelona, where Atletico succeeded in knocking the Catalan team out of the Champions League before the last four for the first time since 2007, sent a loud and clear message: Atletico Madrid are for real.\nTo a great extent, Simeone's assessment of his Atletico team's greatest strengths - hard work and humility - is absolutely right.\nAtletico were only four points above the La Liga relegation zone when Diego Simeone became coach in December 2011. Within 18 months he had guided them to the Europa League, Uefa Super Cup and Copa del Rey titles.\nThe discipline, intensity and sheer, uncompromising effort of their play is unrivalled. That was never more evident in the opening stages on Wednesday, when Atletico's whirlwind of attacking pressure simply blew Barcelona away, resulting in Koke netting the only goal of the game and David Villa thumping shots against the woodwork twice inside the opening 20 minutes.\nHard work and humility - as well as, to use Simeone's other favourite phrase, going from game to game - have allowed Atletico's bunch of largely unheralded journeymen, none of whom (with the exception of Villa) were superstars before they arrived at the Vicente Calderon, to barge their way without an invitation into the upper echelons of world football.\nFor any football fan who has become cynical about the modern game's tendency to be ruled by huge dollops of money, Atletico's unstoppable rise has been a breath of fresh air.\nIn the days of Arab sheikhs, Russian oligarchs and American business tycoons, low-budget teams like Atletico simply aren't supposed to do this well. Yet here they are, with less than six weeks of the season remaining, still in strong contention for the two most prestigious prizes on offer.\nThat is, indeed, largely down to the relentless work ethic instilled by Simeone. But it would be very wrong to suggest that Atletico's current success is simply down to the fact that they run around a lot, because there is also a huge amount of quality and intelligence within their ranks.\nThat starts on the training ground, where Simeone and his gruff assistant Mono Burgos prepare the perfect tactics to suit their team's strengths.\nUnder Simeone's instruction, Atletico are defensively disciplined, unsurpassably organised and play with great game awareness, knowing when to press ferociously in numbers and when to sit deep, waiting for the right opportunity to pounce upon their hapless opponents and launch a rapid, pinpoint counter-attack.\nAs the eloquent Argentine boss explained in the build-up to his team's latest triumph, Barcelona's strength lies in controlling possession; Atletico's lies in controlling space.\nSimeone's attention to detail and his ability to clearly communicate his plans ensures that his players have mastered the art of playing the game where they want to, while simultaneously forcing their opponents into areas where they feel uncomfortable.\nMore than anything, though, Simeone's unbounding positivity and unshakeable belief that good habits, when consistently applied on a day to day basis, will lead to winning performances has succeeded in completely turning Atletico's image on its head.\nFor years, Madrid's second team suffered from a severe inferiority complex as neighbouring Real ruled the roost and the rest of Spain derided them as hapless bunglers who always managed to somehow mess everything up.\nThat reputation was most famously captured in a notorious television advert, when a forlorn young boy asked his frowning father: \"Porque somos del Atleti?\" Why are we Atleti fans? It was a sort of Spanish equivalent to \"Accrington Stanley\u2026who are dey?\" and illustrated the inescapable sense of inevitable doom which habitually engulfed Atletico fans as they lurched from disaster to disaster.\nUnder Simeone, Atletico are finally shattering that conception; their manager is even an image of vibrant self-belief as he prowls the touchline during games, constantly turning to the crowd and vigorously urging them to applaud the players for their wholehearted effort.\nWhen referee Howard Webb blew the final whistle at the Vicente Calderon on Wednesday, tremendous scenes of jubilation were unleashed, with the home fans - chanting and singing with a relentlessness almost matching their team - refusing to leave the shaking stadium until their heroes re-emerged from the tunnel to embark upon a celebratory lap of honour.\nAs the players finally gave way to those demands and dragged their weary bodies back onto the pitch, to be sportingly saluted even by the travelling Barcelona fans, one man was conspicuous by his absence. Diego Simeone was apparently nowhere to be seen.\nBut he was there all right, hiding on his own at the back of the dugout, quietly watching the scenes of celebration he had helped to create with obvious pride, seemingly struggling to force back tears. After the hard work, the humility.\nFormer Liverpool and Republic of Ireland forward Michael Robinson, who finished his playing career in Spain and is now the country's foremost television pundit, concluded his rhapsody over Atletico's performance by enthusing: \"It's impossible not to admire them.\"\nRobinson is exactly right. \"Why are we Atletico fans?\" Right now, the more pertinent question is why anyone wouldn't be.",

    "The Bluefin-21 submersible robot had finished its search of the area and found nothing, they said.\nEfforts would now focus on reviewing search data, surveying the sea floor and bringing in specialist equipment.\nFlight MH370 went missing on 8 March as it flew from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.\nUsing satellite data, officials have concluded that the airliner, which had 239 people on board, ended its journey in the Indian Ocean, north-west of the Australian city of Perth.\nNo trace of the plane has been found and there is no explanation for its disappearance.\nFour pings that officials believed could be from the missing plane's \"black box\" flight recorders were heard by search teams using a towed pinger locator device.\nThese pings were used to define the area for the sea-floor search, conducted by the Bluefin-21. It had scoured over 850 sq km of the ocean floor, JACC said.\n\"Yesterday afternoon, Bluefin-21 completed its last mission searching the remaining areas in the vicinity of the acoustic signals detected in early April by the towed pinger locator,\" a statement from the Joint Agency Co-ordination Centre (JACC) said.\n\"The data collected on yesterday's mission has been analysed. As a result, the JACC can advise that no signs of aircraft debris have been found by the autonomous underwater vehicle since it joined the search effort.\n\"The Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) has advised that the search in the vicinity of the acoustic detections can now be considered complete and in its professional judgement, the area can now be discounted as the final resting place of MH370.\"\nAustralia's Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss said the search had been based on \"the best information available at the time\".\nThe statement came hours after a US Navy official told CNN that the acoustic signals probably came from some other man-made source.\nThe failure of the autonomous sub Bluefin-21 to find any wreckage in the ping search zone is a hammer blow to the families. It's also a sharp reminder to everyone of just how difficult this whole exercise will be.\nWere the pings real or were they simply spurious, a misinterpretation of sound in what is already a very noisy environment? The investigating teams will review again all their data. They will not jump to immediate conclusions. The water column can do strange things with sound, sending it in unexpected directions. The teams will be mindful also that the Bluefin-21 was at times operating beyond its qualified limits.\nThe authorities have now recognised the need to make a proper bathymetric (depth) survey of the wider search zone - some 60,000 sq km in area.\nIt will take at least three months, but once they know precisely the shape and depth of the sea bed they can then better choose the most appropriate vehicles to continue the underwater sweep. Wreckage could be in a ravine, covered by shifted sediment.  Without the right tools, the job of finding MH370 will be that much harder.\n\"Our best theory at this point is that [the pings were] likely some sound produced by the ship... or within the electronics of the towed pinger locator,\" Michael Dean, the US Navy's deputy director of ocean engineering, told the US broadcaster.\n\"Always your fear any time you put electronic equipment in the water is that if any water gets in and grounds or shorts something out, that you could start producing sound,\" Mr Dean said.\nA US Navy spokesmen subsequently described his comments as \"speculative and premature\".\nIn its statement, JACC said an expert working group would continue to review and refine existing data to better define a search area for the missing plane.\nA Chinese ship had already begun mapping an area of ocean floor in a survey process that was expected to take three months.\nMeanwhile, the ATSB would soon seek bids from commercial contractors for the specialist equipment needed for the underwater search - a process expected to begin in August, JACC said.",
    "The minimum prison term has risen from 20 to 40 years.\nIt will apply for all abductions, including those that last only a few hours or days, so-called \"express kidnappings\".\nThe maximum prison sentence will rise from 50 to 140 years for those who kill their victims.\nKidnappings committed by a public security official, such as a member of the police or military, will be punished with up to 100 years in prison.\nKidnappers will also have to pay heavy fines.\nIn reality, few people ever receive sentences longer than 60 years for federal crimes, but kidnapping is considered in a separate category.\nThe number of kidnappings reported to the police has risen dramatically in Mexico in recent years.\nIn 2007, 438 kidnappings were reported, but the number had risen to almost 1,700 last year.\nAnd the government estimates the number of kidnappings reported to the police could be fewer than 2% of the total.\nIf that is the case, the real number of abductions could be about 105,000 per year.\nAnalysts say accurate figures are hard to come by, as many abductions only last for hours or a few days until the victims empty their bank accounts at gunpoint or pay a ransom.\nMost are never reported to the authorities for fear of reprisals from the criminal gang which carried out the kidnapping.\nIn January this year the Mexican government launched a nationwide effort to fight kidnapping.\nA federal prosecutor, Renato Sales, was named to head an anti-kidnapping committee that would co-ordinate efforts to fight abductions in the 10 Mexican states (out of 31) where 74% of all kidnappings take place.\n\"Mexico needs to deal quickly and efficiently with the humanitarian emergency that this crime entails,\" said Mr Sales at the time.",

    "The Bulls' fate has been in the balance since the full extent of their financial worries emerged in the weeks since their dramatic final-day escape sent Chester down instead.\nChester have been reinstated as a Conference Premier club and Hayes & Yeading will stay in Conference South.\n\"Hereford United can have no complaints. The Conference bent over backwards to help them.\n\"I described the news of the board's offer of an extension on Friday evening as not so much 'last chance saloon', but rather 'last orders in last chance saloon' and United have seemingly chosen not to offer the league the assurances they were seeking.\n\"It is a desperately sad day for all Hereford supporters, but the Bulls have nobody to blame but themselves.\n\"You have to feel very sorry for those players who gave their all at Aldershot on the last day of the season to keep Hereford in the Conference Premier. Sadly, those efforts now count for nothing.\"\nThe Conference had originally offered a payment deadline of Thursday, 5 June.\nThe club's debt to their football creditors, including former boss Martin Foyle, members of the current squad, other club staff and clubs from whom the Bulls loaned players during the 2013-14 season, added up to \u00a3148,000.\nThat deadline was extended three times, to Friday, 6 June, then again to Saturday, 7 June and for a third time until Thursday, 12 June.\nBut it became clear on Tuesday that the Bulls, taken over last week by London businessman Tommy Agombar, would not make that deadline - and the Conference has now acted.\nThe last team to be expelled from the Conference was Chester City in February 2010.\nThey reformed as Chester FC two months later - and it is now they who have taken the Bulls' place, following a dramatic final day of the season when, almost simultaneously, a late Hereford winning goal at Aldershot and a Salisbury equaliser at Chester kept the Bulls up.\nBy way of an added twist, Chester announced on Tuesday that Kingsley James, who was in Hereford's team that day, has moved to Bumpers Lane.\n26 April - Hereford stay up on final day of Conference Premier season\n29 April - Hereford United Supporters' Trust make offer to buy the club for \u00a31 and clear their \u00a3220,000 debts\n22 May -  Former Bulls boss Martin Foyle serves winding-up petition over unpaid wages, after players reveal they have not been fully paid too\n2 June - Case adjourned for 28 days at Royal Court of Justice\n3 June - Tommy Agombar takes over as new Hereford owner\n5 June - Hereford fail to meet 17:00 BST deadline to pay football creditors, and are threatened with expulsion, subject to Conference board vote\n6 June - Hereford meet with Conference board and are given new deadline of 7 June. The deadline is moved to 9 June, then 12 June\n10 June - Hereford expelled from Football Conference\nAnd former Hereford boss Foyle, now manager at Southport, chose the same day to sign another player from that same Bulls team, keeper Dan Lloyd-Weston, who opted to leave as he was still owed part of his salary.\nWhen last season ended, despite months of fundraising efforts by fans, as well as generous donations from fans of other clubs, the Bulls faced debts of approximately \u00a3225,000.\nThey still owe over \u00a370,000 to clear the latest PAYE tax demand from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).\nAn offer was made by one of the club's main fan bodies, the Hereford United Supporters' Trust (HUST), on the back of pledges made by their backers, to buy the club for \u00a31 and take over the running at Edgar Street.\nBut, although chairman David Keyte held talks with them, they were not the preferred option.\nKeyte was reported to have been in talks with three different rival bidders before Agombar's takeover.\nThe downward spiral of Hereford's financial situation since being relegated from the Football League in May 2012 has been exacerbated by falling gates.\nThe average attendance for the 2013-14 season at Edgar Street was 1,758, little over half the average gate they attracted of 3,270 in League Two just five years ago.",
    "With more than half the votes counted, President Juan Manuel Santos is leading his conservative rival Oscar Ivan Zaluaga with slightly more than 50%.\nThe campaign has been dominated by discussions on the ongoing peace talks with the leftist Farc rebel group.\nMr Santos, who launched negotiations in November 2012, lost the first round last month by a narrow margin.\nMr Zuluaga says he will impose tougher conditions in order to carry on with the talks.\nMore than 32 million Colombians were eligible to vote, but the turnout was low in the first round at just over 40%.\nMr Zuluaga, 55, is a former finance minister. He received 29% of the vote in the first round, compared to 26% for Mr Santos.\nTheir main disagreement between the two candidates seems to be on how to end a five-decade long conflict with the country's main rebel group, the Farc.\nMr Zuluaga initially said he would pull out of the talks and boost military attacks on the weakened rebel group.\nThat is the line adopted by his mentor, former president Alvaro Uribe, who was elected senator this year and is still one of the most influential figures in Colombian politics.\nLater in the campaign he said he would continue to negotiate with the Farc provided the rebels renounced military action during the talks.\nMr Santos, 62, is aiming to conclude negotiations by the end of the year.\nGovernment negotiators and rebel leaders have held several rounds of talks in the Cuban capital, Havana.\nThey have agreed on three points of the agenda drawn up in 2012:  land reform, future political participation and drug trafficking, which is allegedly the main source of income for the rebels.\nThree other points remain to be agreed on: the rights of the victims, disarmament of the rebels and the implementation of the agreement.\nOn the eve of the vote, Colombia stopped to watch the national team in its opening match in the football World Cup.\nBoth candidates were quick to congratulate the team on its 3-0 victory over Greece in the Brazilian city of Belo Horizonte.\n\"This win for Colombia has moved us; and tomorrow [Sunday], we need to wrap things up by winning the presidency,\" said Mr Zuluaga.\n\"Let's go, Colombia.

    "In one test, nearly half the subjects gave themselves mild electric shocks during 15 minutes of quiet time.\nThe findings, which came from shutting people away with no distractions and then quizzing them, have attracted criticism from some other researchers.\nThe contentious paper, in the journal Science, argues we are not very good at enjoyable, recreational thought.\nProf Timothy Wilson, who led the research at the University of Virginia, US, said: \"Our study participants consistently demonstrated that they would rather have something to do than to have nothing other than their thoughts for even a fairly brief period of time.\"\nThis might not be a surprise if you are easily bored, or have ever picked at a painful scab in a quiet moment.\nIn fact, other researchers in the field have said the findings are overstated.\nBut the authors write that the question of whether people enjoy \"just thinking\" has been overlooked in psychological research.\nTheir work began with several trials involving university students, who were shut in a small room with blank walls and asked to sit at a table \"entertaining themselves with their own thoughts\".\nAfter six, 12 or 15 minutes, they were asked whether the time was enjoyable and whether it was difficult to concentrate. On average, their answers were near the middle of a nine-point scale or worse.\nTo show that this was not a problem arising from the poky laboratory room, or a character flaw unique to flighty students, other experiments required a wider pool of volunteers, aged up to 77, to complete a similar test at home, sitting at a computer. Unpoliced in their own homes, many of them \"cheated\" by checking their phones or listening to music.\nA control group was asked to find an external distraction, alone, like watching TV or browsing the internet, and they had a much better time than those left to try to daydream.\nFinally, Prof Wilson's team did the electric shock experiment to try to find out if quiet, solo thinking was unpleasant enough that people would actually prefer something nasty to happen. Sure enough, 18 of 42 people, more of them men than women, chose to give themselves at least one mild shock on the ankle when left alone for 15 minutes.\n\"It was kind of like a severe static shock, it was not a huge jolt, but it was a little painful,\" Prof Wilson told the BBC's Naked Scientists programme. \"They seem to want to shock themselves out of boredom, so to speak.\"\nThese were all people who had experienced the same shock already and declared that, if given $5, they would part with some of it in order not to be zapped again. People who didn't think they'd pay to avoid the shock were excluded - as was one man who pushed the button 190 times.\n\"I'm not sure what was up with him,\" Prof Wilson said.\nSome UK researchers have questioned aspects of the study, including the level of shock delivered, which was higher for men than women (based on early results in which women rated shocks as more painful) but was not varied between individuals. They point to the fact that individual pain thresholds vary widely, and that hypothetical payments can exaggerate people's answers.\nProf Wilson says he isn't declaring humans incapable of contemplation. \"I don't want to exaggerate this. I do think that all of us, in our daily lives, do find our minds wandering to pleasant topics or thinking about something we're looking forward to. I think what's hard... is doing this on the spot.\"\nProf Ivo Vlaev, a behavioural psychologist at Warwick University and Imperial College, London, thinks the findings are \"very interesting\" but the electric shocks could be over-emphasised.\n\"The bottom line is that they felt miserable,\" he told BBC News. \"Research has shown that happiness is not only about experiencing pleasure. You need a sense of meaning and purpose - which you lack in these conditions. And when you have a task to do, you do have that sense - even if it's a simple task.\"\nDr Chris Chambers, a senior research fellow at Cardiff University's School of Psychology, was less impressed with the results.\n\"This is essentially a study showing that people don't like to be bored,\" he told BBC News. \"How this could take up 11 experiments in a major scientific journal is a little mystifying.\n\"The most interesting aspect to the study is that their research subjects preferred to give themselves electric shocks rather than experience boredom. Perhaps the subjects simply did it to stay awake, and having now read the author's paper from beginning to end I can understand their plight.\"",

    "From a team that lays claim to being the first World Cup winner to a side featuring Chris Waddle's son, the qualifying rounds are full of interesting stories.\nThe long journey to the FA Cup final begins on Friday, with 368 teams competing in the extra preliminary round.\nBBC Sport takes a look at some of the more intriguing stories surrounding those qualifying games.\nWith a long history and a famous tradition, the FA Cup is widely regarded as the most prestigious domestic cup competition in the world.\nWest Auckland Town have reached the first round proper of the competition on three previous occasions, but supporters speak most fondly about their biggest claim to fame - being the first winners of the World Cup.\nThe team from the small County Durham village were invited to participate in the inaugural Sir Thomas Lipton Trophy in 1909. It was one of the first international tournaments in world football and, consequently, was considered by some as the first World Cup.\nWest Auckland Town won the tournament, and repeated that feat two years later, beating Juventus 6-1.\n\"There was nothing about it in the English press at the time, but it was massive news in Italy and all over the newspapers,\" says the club's general manager Stuart Alderson.\n\"We got to keep the trophy and we had it on display until 1994, when it was stolen. We have a replica now, and people still come from all over the world to see it.\"\nWest Auckland begin their pursuit of FA Cup glory at Lancashire-based side Nelson, a team which also boasts a proud history, having been the first English side to beat Real Madrid in Spain.\nThey were a league side during the 1920s, rising to the old Second Division - now the Championship - in 1923, beating the likes of Leeds and Manchester United.\nIn preparation for their first campaign at that level, they opted for a pre-season tour of Spain, where they beat Real Oviedo 2-1 and Real Madrid 4-2.\n\"Everybody is well aware of the team's history in Nelson,\" manager Mark Fell said. \"The story of beating Real Madrid has been passed from generation to generation.\n\"This club has a rich history and it is our job to make this generation proud of their team.\"\nWhen the teams are read out for Staveley Miners Welfare's tie against Worksop Town on Friday night, there could be a very familiar name among them.\nJack Waddle, the 20-year-old son of former England winger Chris, recently signed for Worksop, the side his father played for 15 years ago.\n\"Jack is very much following in his father's footsteps,\" Worksop secretary Paul Stacey said. \"He missed our first two games through injury, however I believe he is in the squad for the FA Cup game.\"\nChris Waddle played in two FA Cup finals at Wembley - losing one with Spurs in 1987 and another with Sheffield Wednesday in 1993.\nWith a World Cup winner and the son of an England winger involved, there is already an international feel to the FA Cup, but that is heightened by the inclusion of FC Romania. It is not the country, of course, but a team named after it.\nFormed by Romanian Ion Vintila and his friends eight years ago, Hertfordshire-based FC Romania have progressed a great deal since playing their first competitive fixture against a team called Beating Chastards.\nThey shot up seven leagues in eight seasons, turned semi-professional this year and have even had a former international footballer on their books.\nClaudiu Raducanu, capped twice by Romania, previously played for Espanyol in Spain and Romanian side Steaua Bucharest, for whom he scored against Southampton in the 2004-05 Uefa Cup.\nHe left in the summer but Vintila has not ruled out the possibility of him returning.

These days the system is set up to be more efficient.\nThe FA sends out an automated text message to each club 15 minutes after kick-off, which explains how the result needs to be reported by text simply by replying to the message. The result and attendance is then published automatically on receipt by The FA of the incoming text message.\nIn order to avoid clubs fielding ineligible players, both teams are required to complete an official team sheet, which is then inspected by a match official, prior to a tie taking place.\nThe above are just a few of the unique tales to come from this year's FA Cup, but we want to hear your FA Cup story.\nDo you have an interesting tale to tell about your team's exploits and do you have any pictures that best sum up the magic of the cup?

FirstGroup and Keolis currently operate TPE in a joint venture.\nThe government said franchise bidders would need to improve customer service and passenger satisfaction on the two networks which carry more than 110 million passengers last year.\nMs Perry said: \"Building a railway that is fit for the 21st century is a vital part of our long-term economic plan, connecting businesses and communities, generating jobs and boosting growth.\"\nOver the next five years, more than \u00c2\u00a31bn will be spent on the rail network in the north, the government has said.

    "We've seen a great deal of attention given over the weekend to a poll from YouGov printed in the Sunday Times, which put the \"Yes\" campaign ahead by 51% to 49%, excluding the don't knows.\nThe first thing to say is that we should not get too excited about a single poll - another poll from Panelbase, for example, still puts the \"No\" campaign ahead.\nThe second thing is that one-off, yes or no elections present peculiar difficulties for pollsters, as the Alternative Voting System referendum in 2011 showed.\nThe way YouGov's polls work  is that they have hundreds of thousands of people registered on their site who may be asked to take part in a poll.\nThe company's computer systems will take a group of people to reflect as closely as possible the electorate in terms of both demography and political views.\nThe responses given will then be weighted to make up for any parts of the panel that were not quite representative of the electorate.\nOne-off elections cause problems because it is hard to predict how big the turnout will be (although pollsters say that is more of a problem for low turnouts than high ones). With general elections, polling organisations may learn from mistakes made in previous campaigns, but with one-off elections they are breaking new ground.\nSo what can we learn from the last two weeks of polling? The gap between the two campaigns does seem to have narrowed to the extent that many commentators now see the referendum as too close to call.\nIt would certainly be a mistake to see a difference of two percentage points between the campaigns as significant.\nPerhaps more significant is a less well-publicised aspect of the YouGov polling.\nBecause its results are taken from a panel, it can check people's responses against what they said in previous polls.\nApparently, almost half of the just over one thousand people included in each of the last two YouGov polls had taken part in another poll since January.\nLooking at just the people who had expressed an opinion in the past, \"in the last few weeks there has been a real and significant shift to yes\", YouGov's Peter Kellner told BBC News.\nOne tenth of those saying \"yes\" now, had not said \"yes\" when asked previously, he said.\nBut while the London-based national newspaper headlines are all about saving the union, another source seems less convinced.\nGambling odds are often a good place to look for this sort of information, because they reflect views that people are prepared to back up with money.\nLooking at the range of odds available on the referendum, most bookmakers are offering about 2-1 against a yes vote and about 4-11 on a no vote, which means you would have to bet \u00c2\u00a3110 to make a \u00c2\u00a340 profit.\nGamblers still clearly think that no to Scottish independence is by far the most likely outcome.",
    "In a wide-ranging interview with the BBC he discusses a number of cricketing issues, including his concerns for the future of Test cricket and next summer's Ashes series in England.\n\"At this time I won't be putting my money on England, but, I will say this about the World Cup; we play Sri Lanka, New Zealand and Australia then three minnows, so if you win against the three minnows, you're into the quarter-finals.\n\"Although we seem to be at sixes and sevens, one-day cricket is a funny game. If you play very well and you get good decisions going for you and bad ones for the opposition, if you get a bit of luck, you can go through on that day and suddenly you're in the semi-final.\"\n\"I think they do focus, they're just not very good at it. Test cricket is more important for England and there's nothing wrong with that. We play quite a lot of one-dayers, we just don't play it very well.\n\"Instead of making excuses maybe we should put our hand up and say it isn't working and we have to have a re-think and open up our minds a bit and get into the modern way. We're still trying to play nice cricket with our opening batsmen. Other teams come in and they plunder it these days. It has taken a long time to get Alex Hales in, who is powerful, and give him a go. That seems to be the modern game, there is a lot of power involved.\"\n\"We're not sure who should play in the middle order - we dropped Ravi Bopara, who was quite good. The selectors are very nice people - James Whitaker, chairman, Mick Newell of Notts - but they have never played international cricket. I think James has played one Test match. Gus Fraser, who I admire, he hasn't played international cricket for over 10 years and the coach Peter Moores, he has never played anything at all, so if I was batting I don't think I'd be asking him for advice.\n\"I think it's an important factor, it's not belittling them. I don't think you have to be a great player but I do think you have to have played some international cricket, and been around the international scene, been on tour. [Former national selector] Geoff Miller was very good, 34 Tests. He wasn't a great name, but he'd been around lots of tours and I'm sure that helps.\"\n\"The second-string seam bowling. Stuart Broad and James Anderson are very, very good but it's the second string when the pressure on the opposition eases quite alarmingly. They're trying people at the moment like Chris Woakes, Chris Jordan, who's got an awful run-up, and it's not there yet. Off-spin, left-arm spin, they don't seem to have one. Moeen Ali's getting a go but Graeme Swann has been a big loss.\n\"Then the batting isn't solid enough. I've always believed in Test cricket you win from a platform of runs on the board. I'm quite aware of the old saying you need bowlers to take 20 wickets to win, but it's very difficult if your batsmen don't make any runs and bowlers are always under pressure.\n\"The best sides make a lot of runs, they're never really in much danger. We have too many low scores, too many difficulties where we're climbing a mountain for batting badly in the first innings. We don't put enough big scores on the board.\"\n\"The umpires feel more comfortable being able to report them in privacy rather than having to call them in a match. The Laws of the game are held by MCC, from Test cricket to school cricket. The ICC decide, just like the PGA Tour in golf, to have localised rules and they have this rule whereby you can bend and straighten your arm 15 degrees, that is a local rule by the ICC and not the Laws of the game. Many of us don't agree with it but we live by it because that's the rules.\n\"I have always believed to bowl the doosra you have to bend and straighten your arm - that's throwing. Now they have legalised throwing up to 15 degrees. You can tell as a cricketer when somebody has a funny action, but the ICC has chosen at international level to have some boffins in a studio with lights and camera and all kinds of mechanics to say he bends and straightens it - which is really a euphemism for throwing - 10 degrees, so he's alright.\"\n\"Last time in England it was pretty close, it should have been 2-2. It will be close again and it depends how we develop by next year.\n\"England are hoping Moeen will improve. He's done alright so far, his batting has shown glimpses, his bowling has shown glimpses but he's got to do a bit more than that. You can't just flit in and out with your batting and bowling to play well at Test level.\n\"If Mitchell Johnson gets injured and can't play, the odds may come towards England, but Ryan Harris is important too. He has had injuries, so they may have to nurse him a bit. At the moment, they're better placed than us, although in sport it can change quickly.\"\n\"It's a problem and we might have missed the boat, it might be too late. It will still be alright while I'm alive but I don't know about 30 or 40 years. There is nothing certain about Test cricket because as much as we love it and we think it's the best test of a cricketer for his character, his courage and his technique, one-day cricket has become so important to people.\n\"We've seen for the first time in England that when it's not Australia it's difficult to sell the seats. Lord's will always sell out because it's the Mecca, people want to go, it's an iconic place. But at Headingley or Southampton we're struggling to sell the seats and that will happen more and more.\"\n\"I've thought for a long time the ticket prices are too high. The people who run the game might find they are going to have to address that in the coming years.\n\"For years, I have advocated that two grown-ups and two youngsters free should be a family ticket to make it more affordable, but next year the best tickets will be over \u00a3100 at Lord's and more than \u00a380 at other places.\n\"For a couple, that's a hundred and plenty, so they might think 'let's go somewhere else that doesn't cost as much'. That will happen more and more.\"\n\"I haven't a clue. I won't have a say in it will I?\n\"Adversity never breaks a good man, it fines him down like gold so he rises up a better man.

    "Beat estimates 80% of those affected by eating disorders in the UK have misused laxatives in order to lose weight.\nIt says supermarkets have done nothing to restrict sales of the medicine to young people.\nUK supermarkets say their sale of laxatives complies with regulation set by the medicines regulator, the MHRA.\nBeat says eating disorders most commonly develop during adolescence.\nTeens are turning to stimulant laxatives believing they can quickly lose weight, with some children known to be taking dozens of laxative pills on a daily basis, they say.\nMedical professionals warn that laxative abuse can cause diarrhoea, dehydration and electrolyte imbalances that can lead to kidney failure.\nIt can also damage the liver and potentially damage the heart leading to heart failure and death.\nBeat wants supermarkets and retailers to reduce the ease with which young people can buy laxatives in large quantities.\nThe charity is calling for a minimum purchase age of 16, the maximum pack size reduced to ten tablets, sales restricted to pharmacies and a warning label on packets that states \"this is not a weight loss product\".\nThe Dulcolax and Senokot tablets currently have age restrictions on the packets.\nDulcolax states that the dosage instructions are for adults and children over 10, and children under 10 should consult a doctor before taking them.\nThe Senokot packet advises the dosage instructions are for adults and children over twelve, and that children 6 years and older should consult a doctor before taking them. They do not recommend the drug for children under 6.\nBoth and Dulcolax and Senokot say that they treat the issue of eating disorders very seriously and say they fully comply with all the legal requirements made by MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency).\n\"We've seen a 30% increase in calls to our help lines over the last year where people have mentioned overusing laxatives in unhealthy way,\" Susan Ringwood, chief executive of Beat, told BBC Watchdog.\n\"And that does include a significant number of young people as well,\" she added.\nLottie Hall is 17 years old.

    "Customers are being charged up to \u00a3200 for exceeding their time slot by as little as half an hour.\nA CAS report has criticised poor practice including unclear signage and misleading parking tickets.\nCAS is concerned about the effect on elderly and disabled Scots.\nCAS describe the level of complaints in 2012/2013 as \"unprecedented\", with over 3,653 parking enquires - an increase of 50% on the previous year.\nThere is currently no specific legislation or regulations regarding parking on private land in Scotland. Nor is there a system of appeal, unlike in England and Wales.\nThe CAS report highlights the use of \"misleading\" private parking tickets using terminology such as \"Parking Charge Notice\", which many people confuse with statutory \"Penalty Charge Notices\", issued by police or local authorities.\nBoth are abbreviated to PCN, but only Penalty Charge Notices are fines with legal standing.\nThe report also criticises poor car park signage, which leaves customers unsure of how long they can park and how much they will be charged, and failing to take into account reasonable mitigating circumstances.\nScottish local authorities have regulations set upon the amount they can charge for parking infractions - usually a \u00a360 penalty, reduced to \u00a330 if paid on time.\nThe CAS report found that private parking charges range from \u00a340 to \u00a3200 with many around \u00a3100, which could be considered \"excessive\".\nIt also noted the fact that disabled drivers have been penalised for small infractions or supposedly failing to display their disabled badge, when in fact they had done so.\nCAS chief executive Margaret Lynch said that some private parking companies do behave fairly and according to industry guidelines, but criticised those that \"don't use proper signage, charge inflated fees and then fail to respond properly to people who appeal.\"\nShe said: \"To the parking companies we say clean up your industry and offer a fair deal to your customers. To the Scottish government we say introduce regulations so that Scottish drivers have the same protections as those in England and Wales.\n\"And to drivers themselves we say make sure you know your rights and that you stand up for them. We will help you do that, and between us we can end this problem and create a fairer system.\"\nA spokesman for Scottish government agency Transport Scotland said: \"There are clearly concerns about some private parking companies and how they manage off-street parking, including the level of fines applied in some cases.\n\"Disputes over private parking in Scotland can be resolved in the small claims court and we would remind all companies that they have a responsibility to operate within the law.\n\"While legislation already exists to protect road users from over-zealous private car park owners, we look forward to engaging with Citizens Advice Scotland to discuss their report and the important issues raised by it.\"",
    "A stake in a local energy business could cost from just \u00c2\u00a35, and the industry says it could generate an annual return of between 6% and 9%.\nThe scheme aims to reduce local opposition to renewable energy development.\nIt has been developed by the renewable industry alongside community groups.\nThe Shared Ownership Taskforce plan follows similar programmes in Denmark which have been running for more than two decades.\nIt applies to anything entering the planning system from Monday.\nMore than 70% of people in the UK nationally say they like wind farms, according to a government survey.\nHowever, proximity often provokes a different response and the wind farms are frequently considered a blot on the landscape.\nThe government previously insisted that wind farm developers should give local communities \u00c2\u00a35,000 a year for every megawatt of energy installed - to support local initiatives.\nThe taskforce goes further by insisting that any new applications entering the planning system must offer to sell part of their business to locals - somewhere between 5 and 25%. This can be in the form of directly-owned shares, crowd-funding or debentures.\nNina Skorupska, Chief Executive, Renewable Energy Association welcomes the plan. She told BBC News:  \"Elsewhere in Europe this is commonplace, so we're very pleased the UK is also working towards this vision of a more open energy market.\"\nThe scheme has been promoted by the Energy and Climate Change Secretary, Edward Davey.

In part that's because the easiest reforms took place in the first 18 months of Thein Sein's presidency.\nIn the Burmese context, \"easy\" means decisions that don't upset the army.\nPolitical prisoners were released, censorship of newspapers and the internet lifted and a (flawed) law passed allowing public demonstrations.\nIn a short period of time, one of the world's most tightly controlled societies opened up in a way few had thought possible.\nStories critical of ministers were suddenly on the front page of private newspapers, and demonstrations, mostly connected to land rights, have become almost daily events.\nBut the early pace of those changes hasn't been sustained. There was no way it could.\nSo did the reformers run out of steam? Did Thein Sein's project reach a roadblock manned by hardliners in the Burmese army? Or perhaps we're close to the final destination - that is, with sanctions lifted and the army still really in charge.\nMs Suu Kyi's main frustration is that the constitution remains unchanged.\nDrafted in 2008, it entrenches the military's control of political life, guaranteeing it a quarter of the seats in the Hluttaw (the Burmese parliament), and a veto over any changes to the constitution.\nThis is what its architects proudly call a \"disciplined democracy\".\nThe opposition have focused on the two parts they want changed most.\nThey are: the clause barring anyone who has foreign family members from becoming president, which effectively prevents Ms Suu Kyi from taking power (because of her British sons) and Article 436, which gives the army a veto on constitutional changes.\nMuch of Ms Suu Kyi's annoyance stems from the fact that the legislature that she joined in 2012, and thus legitimised, is now being cynically used to thwart her ambition.\nJust as it would in mature democracies, responsibility for shaping the constitutional reform process was handed to a series of parliamentary committees.\nWith each committee mirroring the composition of the military-dominated Hluttaw, they've deliberated for months and delivered entirely predictable results.\nAltering the \"Suu Kyi clause\" has been dismissed outright (as a threat to national sovereignty), while amending Article 436 will be discussed in parliament, though if the army remains opposed there's no way it can be changed.\nMs Suu Kyi's slim hopes of taking the top job after the election in 2015 now rest on a backroom deal among senior leaders.\nLooming in many minds is the possibility of a constitutional crisis this time next year. What if the party that wins the most seats is unable or unwilling to nominate a president?\nThough the changes that Aung San Suu Kyi wants most have stalled, that's not to say there haven't been other important developments.  It's just that they don't directly involve Ms Suu Kyi.\nEver since independence in 1948, Myanmar has never been truly at peace, with minority ethnic groups fighting guerrilla wars against the Burman-dominated state.\nThe last three years has seen real progress towards what would be an unprecedented nationwide ceasefire agreement. All the major rebel groups have been brought into the process, attracted by the promise of dialogue on a more federal future.\nFor President Thein Sein, a peace agreement would be the crowning achievement of what's likely to be his only term in office. Unfortunately for him, with a deal within reach, the number of clashes has begun to increase once more.\nOutside politics, particularly in the big cities, people's lives are changing fast.\nThanks to new laws and regulations, Myanmar's economy and banking sectors are liberalising and opening up to the outside world. GDP growth is rapid, though improvements in living standards still lag a long way behind.\nOn Myanmar's streets two new foreign phone companies are currently battling it out for a lucrative new market.\nAfter years in which mobile phones and the internet were government-run and SIM cards the preserve of the elite, there's now the prospect of low-cost data and unrestricted access to information. In itself that's a game-changer.\nSo is the Myanmar reform glass half full or half empty?  It rather depends who you are, and what you're drinking.",

    "In the three months to June 2014, there were 960 initial decisions to place a child for adoption, compared with 1,830 in the three months to September 2013.\nThe figures were released by the Adoption Leadership Board (ALB).\nThe ALB says the drop in adoptions may have been influenced by recent court judgements in care and adoption cases.\nThe board, which was established by the government as part of a shake-up of the adoption system, said applications for court orders allowing a child to be placed for adoption had fallen by 34%.\nThere had also been a fall of 54% in the number of placement orders granted by courts, from 1,650 to 750, it said.\nIn recent years, adoption figures had risen to record levels, with an increase of 63%, the ALB said.\nBut last September, the most senior family court judge criticised the \"sloppy practice\" of social workers when bringing cases for adoption before the courts and said they were not looking closely enough at all the other options.\nPresident of the Family Division, Sir James Munby, also implied that, at a time of tight budgets, adoption may be seen as a cheaper option than helping troubled families or foster carers and warned about \"resource issues\" affecting local authorities' thinking.\nHe said there had been four cases during 10 days in July alone in which judges had expressed concerns about inadequate analysis by social services  in support of the case for adoption.\nALB chairman, Sir Martin Narey, said these court judgements had been \"entirely sensible\".\nBut he warned that they were being misinterpreted by local authorities who thought the law on adoption had changed.\nHe told the BBC that the recent drop in children being put forward for adoption was primarily due to fewer local authorities deciding adoption was the best option for a child.\n\"It's then been compounded by the refusal of some applications at the court,\" he said.\nSir Martin said some councils seemed to have taken some court rulings to mean that if a child could remain in foster care, then \"that will do\", when in fact the best interests of the child must be pursued.\nSir Martin said the drop followed two years of significant progress in finding more adoptive homes for the thousands of children waiting.\nThe number of children adopted across the UK has risen from 3,100 in 2011 to  5,050 in the last year.\nThe recent fall in children being put forward for adoption in England  has prompted  Sir Martin to issue guidance to clarify the meaning of recent court judgements.\n\"It is clear from my discussions with social workers and managers in local authorities and in voluntary adoption agencies that there is a belief that the law has been fundamentally changed by a number of court judgements.\n\"So I am pleased to produce this simple myth-busting guide - drafted by a senior queen's counsel - to what those judgements do and do not say.\n\"I am extremely grateful to Sir James Munby, president of the Family Division, for his advice. He has seen the document and is supportive of its aim of dispelling the myths that have arisen.\"\nMessages included in Sir Martin's guidance reiterated that the legal test for adoption had not changed, and courts must be provided with expert, high quality, evidence-based analysis of all realistic options for a child and the arguments for and against each of these.\nSir Martin said: \"The board and I have published this guide to help everyone working for children understand the law around these complex cases, and be confident in making the right decisions for the child.\"",
    "The Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) has taken a look at Network Rail's performance between April and October this year, and found it wanting in key areas.\nMaintenance work is already \u00a340m over budget, and rising.\nPunctuality is 0.7% below target.\nAnd the ORR has once again cast doubt on the data that Network Rail uses to make important decisions on which bits of the network to mend or renew, and when. Bad data means more delays for passengers and higher costs for the taxpayer.\nTo give you an example, maintenance crews across Britain record what they do in different ways.\nNetwork Rail told me that in some parts of the country they use miles, in other parts they use kilometres, so when two teams record the fact that they've fixed \"three units\" of line, some mean three miles, others mean three kilometres. I don't need to spell out what a mess that makes.\nAnd it doesn't end there. Some fill in forms, others use electronic devices. If you bear in mind that over the six months covered by this health check, about 35 million work orders were generated by maintenance staff, you can imagine how confusing it all gets.\nThe regulator has been trying to crack the whip on the reliability of this data for some time now. But there's a legacy of red tape on the railways, and it won't be cheap to sort out.\nRichard Price at the ORR says: \"Without up-to-date knowledge, Network Rail will not have sufficient understanding of how and why its assets fail and its maintenance approach will remain reactive - leading to inefficiencies and hindering its efforts to improve punctuality.\nHe adds: \"The new management at the company has made it clear that it shares our concerns and has committed to address these issues.\"\nThe current overspend is a worry too. Network Rail has a \u00a338bn budget for the next five years, so how is it already \u00a340m over-budget, and heading for \u00a3122m across the year?\nWell, it's mainly down to two extra projects.\nThe relatively new boss, Mark Carne, has ordered a clean-up of the lines. All those spare bits of old track you see lying about, the old mattresses, the Buddleia - he wants it all gone.\nThe second project goes back to red-tape again. Mark Carne wants a much slimmer, more-focused safety book for maintenance staff. Again, there's a legacy of thousands of rules that he wants cut, so that people understand what to focus on.\nMark Carne hails from the oil industry, don't forget, and in our last interview he talked a lot about safety culture.\nHis response to today's report?\n\"The railway continues to see strong growth in passenger numbers, however, we know that there are too many passengers that do not get the level of reliability they have a right to expect and that this has a real impact on their daily lives.\n\"Increasing capacity on a complex network, at the same time as keeping it running every day, is the challenge we face. We have clear strategies to deliver the improvements required.\"\nThere is one positive highlight from the regulator. Network Rail has made good progress on level crossing safety, mainly through new technology or just closing them down.",

    "\"Bonkers Bruno Locked Up\", was changed to \"Sad Bruno in Mental Home\" by the time later editions rolled off the presses.\nThe revised words were still criticised by mental health charities.\nEleven years on, after high-profile cases including Stan Collymore,Marcus Trescothick,Neil Lennon and Robert Enke, has the reporting of mental health issues in sport improved?\nA panel including cricketer Michael Yardy, whose depression became public knowledge after he left England's 2011 World Cup campaign, and the Professional Footballers' Association head of welfare Michael Bennett met at MediaCity UK in Salford to discuss how they would change reporting of mental health in sport.\nIt may be tempting to look for indications of a sportsperson's mental health while they are under the spotlight in competition.\nBut it is often when people are free to reflect, rather than when they are consumed by the action, that problems can arise.\n\"After I left the World Cup, Geoffrey Boycott took my depression to be a reflection of my performances,\" explained Yardy.\n\"But it is not always about performance.\n\"There are times that I have performed brilliantly, driven home, gone to bed and not been right in myself.\n\"I think I had my worst bouts of depression during the winter months when I have been away from cricket.\n\"Sometimes it is actually nice to have the ball and bat in your hand and it is just you in that moment.\n\"Conversely fielding can actually be quite difficult because if you have bowled a bad last over or something you can 'catastrophe' things.\"\n\"There is an assumption in the media sometimes that something on the field of play has triggered these issues and it is not always the case,\" added Daily Telegraph columnist Jim White.\nA survey by mental health charity Mind earlier this year showed that 60% of people were encouraged to seek help for their own mental illness after learning about a sportsperson with similar problems.\nCoverage of a sportsperson's problems will have an effect on those consuming it just as it does on the star at the centre.\n\"The way that these are issues are dealt with around big heroes in the sports pages is read, watched and listened to be people who suffer from depression themselves,\" said White.\n\"If the analysis is that a sportsperson should have nothing to worry about, then you start to question the validity of your own problems.\n\"The way we deal with it is not just to be sensitive to the suffer themselves, but the way it is presented to everyone else.\"\nWhen England batsman Jonathan Trott left the Ashes tour of Australia in November with what the ECB described as, a \"long-standing stress-related condition\", the end of Marcus Trescothick's international career came to mind.\nWracked with depression, Trescothick dissolved into tears at Heathrow's duty-free in 2006, as he prepared to board a flight to Australia with his team-mates.\nBut Trott later revealed that he was \"emotionally and mentally spent\" rather than depressed when he flew home. Former England captain Michael Vaughan said that he felt conned by the impression that Trescothick and Trott's cases were similar.\n\"A lot of players come to talk to me about things and I'm happy to speak to them but I have my own issues and everyone is very different,\" said Yardy.\n\"It is very dangerous to say that one case of depression is the same as another.\"\n\"It is now very clear that Jonathan Trott was not in the same boat as Marcus Trescothick,\" Sky News Sports editor Nick Powell added.\nStories about mental health issues tend to focus on the trauma suffered, rather than the triumph over the odds.\n\"We never talk about positive mental health, it is always seen negatively,\" said Bennett.\n\"We need to change that around so it is seen as a positive that someone is confident enough to come forward and share their issues.\"\n\"People who have suffered with mental health are actually very strong in that they have kept it inside so long and continued on in spite of it,\" added Yardy.\nIt is the white noise to which the serious business of the dressing room is played out to - joking and joshing, mockery and mirth. But does banter have to stop when it comes to mental illness?\n\"In a strange way I embrace it, because the worse thing can be that people feel they can't have a joke with you,\" said Yardy.\n\"People do take the mickey out of me, but in a closed environment and they know the boundaries. You obviously have to know somebody very well.\"",

    "Researchers hope to learn how much it weighed, how it moved and what it used its iconic back plates for.\nA UK team has scanned each of its 360 bones into a computer and has digitally reconstructed the dinosaur.\nThe specimen, nicknamed \"Sophie\", has been acquired by the Natural History Museum in London.\nAlthough Stegosauruses are one of the most well known dinosaurs, they are among those that scientists know the least about.

    "Media playback is not supported on this device\nIt began when he left behind a glamorous Manhattan lifestyle for the wonder and wastelands of Sierra Leone five years ago. It will end when he walks through the front door of the family home in Lisburn, Belfast for Christmas, having lived through an incredible time in modern history.\nVery few 29-year-olds have managed a national football team. None have done it while that country is being brought to its knees by Ebola. \"I'm very sad, very emotional,\" he said.\n\"Saying goodbye to Sierra Leone was very emotional, very difficult. I don't keep my distance from things; I invest emotionally. The country has become part of me.\"\nHaving been an academy coach with the New York Red Bulls, McKinstry was appointed technical director of the Craig Bellamy academy in Sierra Leone at the age of 24.\nBy 27, he was manager of the national team. Within 18 months his squad were in the top 50 of the world rankings for the first time. \"I've made a career of proving doubters wrong,\" he said.\nTwo months ago he was sacked by email, as the Ebola outbreak gathered momentum.\n\"We believed we had the chemistry, cohesion and spirit to achieve anything. But the Ebola outbreak changed everything. Circumstances meant that, in the end, it was an impossible job.\"\nMcKinstry stepped off a plane four hours before we met in a London hotel. He had not slept for the best part of two days.\nThe journey to Freetown Airport had to be made by boat to avoid some of the areas worst affected by Ebola. An early flight meant crossing the night before.\nA night at an airport, one plane to Morocco, another to London followed by a medical check by customs officers is no ordinary preparation for an interview. But for a man who has spent much of the past six months living in lockdown, being among the bustle again is a welcome change.\nHis time in Sierra Leone has now come to an end. The memory of it will, however, live on.\n\"In the last month or so when I went into Freetown for supplies, I started to see more of the Ebola response teams, with the full yellow bio-hazard suits,\" he said. \"You might see an ambulance driving past and even the driver would be in the full bio-hazard gear.\n\"When you see that it really does bring it home to you just how serious the situation is.\"\nMcKinstry was offered a way out, a safe passage home in July, but refused it. Many of the players in the academy were from affected areas, he felt he had a duty of care not to walk away and send the young footballers into danger.\nInstead he quarantined the academy behind the gate and walls of the compound. \"When the outbreak started a lot of people ran for cover,\" he said.\n\"But Ebola is a disease of contact, if you remove the contact, you remove the risk. So that is what we did. We moved everyone who was off site, behind the walls. We had generators for power, bore holes for fresh water, we had dorm rooms, classrooms and a football pitch.\"\nIn Northern Ireland his family were growing increasingly worried about the situation. Did they want him home? \"They wanted information. They wanted to know what was going on, to know that I was safe, that the boys at the academy were safe,\" he said.\nIt is not sensationalist to suggest that the Ebola virus cost McKinstry his job as head coach. But before he explained how it came to an end, he addressed the question of how it all began.\n\"When it comes to football, confidence has not been something I have been lacking,\" McKinstry said with a smile. \"There is a saying in Newcastle - 'shy bearns get nowt' - if you don't ask you don't get.\n\"That was my attitude to the Sierra Leone job. I know I was 27 but if they said no, nothing is lost. If they said yes, it was going to be the start of an exciting new chapter.\"\nMcKinstry had watched every Sierra Leone home game in person, every away game on TV, he had watched them train, studied their players. \"I thought I was the best man for the job,\" he added. \"I got in the room with the decision-makers and I went through Sierra Leone's last two games with a fine tooth comb and Tunisia's last two, who would be our next opponents.\n\"I outlined how I'd beat Tunisia, how I saw the future. Every member of the panel went away with a dossier, which I told them they could keep and use even if they didn't choose me.\n\"Two days later they offered me the job.\"\nMcKinstry made an impressive start, losing just one of his first six matches and leading Sierra Leone into the top 50 of Fifa's world rankings, above Northern Ireland, the Republic, Cameroon and Senegal. Then the Ebola outbreak happened and football became a side issue.\n\"We looked at what little we could do as sporting heroes, could we put smiles on the faces of the nation?\" McKinstry said. \"Football is a second religion in Sierra Leone.\n\"So when the national team wins, the national psyche is buoyed, everyone walks an inch or two taller. We made a commitment to keep on winning to try to qualify for the Africa Cup of Nations so that people in the country would feel a little bit better. Unfortunately it wasn't to work out that way.\"\nThe Confederation of African Football ruled that Sierra Leone could not play games at home. A challenging task was becoming a near-impossible one. \"In football, the home team tends to win 50% of the time. In Africa, the home team wins 65 or 70% of the time,\" McKinstry explained.\nThat was not the only complication. \"In my final game, against DR Congo, we had 17,000 fans just chanting 'Ebola, Ebola, Ebola' at us. It was upsetting for our players. The atmosphere was difficult. It made the players angry that people were mocking the situation in their homeland,\" he said.\nSierra Leone players found opponents unwilling to shake hands, hotels unwilling to check them in and governments uncertain on granting them entry. \"People fear things they don't know,\" he said. \"Hotel arrangements were monitored wherever we went, there were daily medical checks for my players and, while that is not overly difficult, it can impact on players' mental state.\"\nSierra Leone's first group game as they attempted to qualify for the African Cup of Nations was away to Ivory Coast in early September.\nWith a week to go, McKinstry was still unsure whether he and his players would be allowed into the country. The confusion meant some players had to buy their own plane tickets. Others arrived the night before the game.\nSierra Leone led for an hour, only to lose 2-1. The demands of their schedule meant the squad left at 11pm that night to fly to DR Congo for a 'home' qualifier that was to be played in the away team's stadium. That game too ended in a 2-0 defeat and was marred by chants of 'Ebola, Ebola.'\nMcKinstry did not see the end coming. He said: \"I had been in the FA building that day and not once was anything mentioned.

    "It's a vivid metaphor from Dr Udai Banerji, of the Institute of Cancer Research and the Royal Marsden, for the challenge facing patients, scientists and clinicians.\nOver the past 18 months, I've been part of a Panorama team that has followed a group of remarkable cancer patients who are on clinical trials run jointly by the two organisations.\nI met patients like Sophie Armitage, who was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer called IMFT when she was just nine; and Tami Morris, who has had ovarian cancer for more than a decade.\nTami, like many of those in the trials, has advanced cancer, which has spread from its original site to other parts of the body.\nWith Sophie, the tumour was localised, but growing around her airway and so making it both dangerous and difficult to treat.\nBoth patients are on different forms of targeted drug treatment, part of a new range of weapons against cancer.\nUnlike conventional chemotherapy, which attacks all rapidly dividing cells, targeted drugs focus on the genetic mutations that drive cancer growth.\nThe key to this new generation of cancer drugs is our greater understanding of human genetics.\nA revolution in DNA sequencing means the disease can be mapped faster, cheaper and in greater detail than ever.\nFor Tami Morris, it has meant that pills she takes at home have replaced and outperformed chemotherapy.\nShe told me: \"Five years ago, before the Marsden, I thought that was it. But they've given me a good four years so far.\"\nTami has been on a succession of different targeted treatments designed for patients with specific mutations in their cancer.\nAlthough the drugs have often worked well for some time, eventually her cancer has developed resistance to them, meaning her doctors have had to keep switching her medication.\nCancer resistance is probably the biggest problem facing scientists.\nWatch Panorama: 'Can You Cure My Cancer?' on BBC One on 11 February  at 21.00 GMT or later on the BBC iPlayer.\nBBC iPlayer\nResearchers at the ICR labs in London discovered some years ago that cancer survives through Darwinian evolution.\nProf Johann de Bono is in charge of nearly 40 early drug trials: \"Resistance is a major issue because these are cancers that are genetically unstable, they can change and they evolve, we call this clonal evolution.\"\nBut new drugs are coming through all the time, and so far, the doctors at the ICR and Royal Marsden - who divide their time between laboratories and the clinic - have been able to find a new treatment for Tami.\nBy using drugs in combination or even in rotation, scientists are trying to keep pace with cancer resistance.\nIt will be a key strategy in transforming the disease into a manageable long-term condition.\nOf course, the prospects for cancer patients are far brighter now than ever.\nAlthough one in two of us in our lifetime will hear the words, \"You have cancer,\" survival rates have doubled in the past 40 years.\nCurrently, one in two cancer patients will live at least a decade, and that proportion is increasing each year.\nSome, like Sophie Armitage, can hopefully look forward to a future free from the disease.\nHer tumour was due to a faulty ALK gene, which creates a chemical signal that drives the growth of abnormal cells.\nThe experimental drug she is taking, LDK 378, blocks those messages.\nThe treatment is showing promise against some forms of adult lung cancer.\nSophie had been facing surgery to remove one of her lungs.\nBut within weeks of starting on the trial her tumour had shrunk from the size of a plum to that of a hazel-nut.\nIt has continued to shrink to a point where doctors believe it may be completely inactive.\nHer consultant, Dr Louis Chesler, described Sophie's case as life-affirming.\n\"It's the goal of every paediatric oncologist to see that kind of response.\n\"It's truly astonishing and miraculous to see.  I think we told her in the clinic that she's unique, and that really she's a miracle child.\"\nSophie, who's now 11, says being part of a medical trial has spurred her on to think about what she will do in later life.\nShe told me: \"I've always wanted to be a doctor, and now I've gone through all this I want to be a doctor even more.\"\nAs well as extending life with targeted treatments, scientists are also exploring how to harness the body's inbuilt defences by boosting the power of the immune system.\nCancer immunotherapy has had some spectacular success in recent years, notably in the treatment of malignant melanoma - an aggressive form of skin cancer.\nVicky Brown's melanoma was found only after it had spread to her breast and lungs.\nUntil recently the life expectancy for patients with such advanced disease was around six months, but Vicky enrolled on a trial at the Royal Marsden comparing two immunotherapy treatments, ipilimumab and nivolumab.\nThese drugs help the body's killer cells to recognise cancer cells and prevent malignant cells from blocking the natural immune response.\nVicky had to come off the trial early as she developed hepatitis and meningitis - serious but treatable side-effects which were the result of her immune system being supercharged.\nFortunately, by then the immunotherapy had worked and she remains clear of cancer after more than a year.\nVicky said: \"I can really get on with my life and put this in the back of my mind.\"\nHer consultant at the Royal Marsden, Dr James Larkin, is hopeful that immunotherapy may even be able to deal with the problem of resistance.\nHe told me: \"With immunotherapy, you've reprogrammed the system so inside the patient you have an immune system that can recognise tumour cells.\n\"If a bit of the tumour does become resistant, the experience to date certainly seems to be that the immune system can still deal with that.\"\nSeveral immunotherapy drugs are undergoing trials for other cancers, such as lung and kidney, and early results look promising.\nLike all new cancer treatments, they are expensive - just one of the drugs Vicky was given costs \u00c2\u00a375,000 per patient, although the NHS has negotiated a confidential discounted price.\nSo while these new weapons offer the hope of keeping cancer at bay for longer, they present hard choices for health spending.\nPanorama's 'Can You Cure My Cancer?'  is on Wednesday 11 February at 21:00 on BBC One.",

    "They last for three months, which is long enough to sap the finances of the political parties and the energy of voters, battered by a never-ending string of cheap shots in cheap internet videos.\nCampaign 2015 is coming to the boil rather nicely now with the latest opinion polls suggesting that a centre-left alliance is running ahead of the hawkish Likud Party headed by Benjamin Netanyahu.\nThat does not necessarily mean he will be forced from office - he could still form a right-wing coalition. But election night on 17 March promises to be an exciting affair.\nOutsiders, though, might be surprised that the moribund state of the vexed peace process between Israel and the Palestinians has never felt like a major campaign issue.\nIt is there in the background all the time, of course, as the central historical and strategic issue that his faced this country since the Middle East war of 1967 when it captured Gaza from Egypt and the West Bank from Jordan.\nIt captured the Golan Heights from Syria too, but that raises a different set of strategic issues which are separate from this particular diplomatic equation.\nVoters know that the Zionist Union - the name chosen for the alliance between Yitzhak Herzog's Labour Party and Tzipi Livni's movement Hatnuah - would approach the prospect of talking to the Palestinians about a \"land-for-peace\" deal with more enthusiasm than Mr Netanyahu.\nAt one point in the campaign there was a brief controversy about whether a speech Mr Netanyahu made six years ago, cautiously embracing the concept of the Two-State solution, was still valid.\nHis view appears to be that in an unstable Middle East where Iraq and Syria are disintegrating a newly-created Palestinian state could quickly become an ungoverned territory over-run by Islamist extremists.\nHis many detractors might see in that an excuse for avoiding a deal for which he did not have much enthusiasm in the first place, but part of Mr Netanyahu's pitch to the Israeli people is that he is cautious in such matters - a steady, statesmanlike hand on matters affecting Israel's security.\nSo while the peace process might be the prism through which outsiders tend to view Israeli politics, this campaign has centred much more on the economy - problems like the way in which the cost of housing outstrips the spending power of ordinary Israelis are front and centre.\nAnd what political scientists call the low-participation rate of the ultra-Orthodox communities in the economy and in the army is a major fault-line between secularists like the Yesh Atid movement and the religious parties like Shas.\nYaakov Peri is a former head of Israel's internal security agency the Shin Bet - a job which required him to reflect deeply on his country's relationship with Palestinian society as he bore responsibility for neutralising the threat of militant groups.\nBefore the last coalition collapsed he was Minister of Science and Technology and this time around he is a candidate once again for the centrist Yesh Atid.\nHe says this is an issue where it is up to the government to lead.\n\"The Israeli public cares about the cost of living and housing and the street doesn't feel the urgency of a deal with the Palestinians or a regional approach,\" he told me.\n\"It's a reality and you should look at it when running an election campaign.\"\nYou get a sense of the tensions that brought down the last coalition when you discuss the same issues with Naftali Bennett, leader of the nationalist right-wing party Habayit Hayehudi who also sat in the outgoing cabinet.\nHe has said that there should never be a Palestinian state in the West Bank because to create one would be to create an existential threat to the Jewish State.\n\"It would,\" he said, \"spell calamity for the future of Israel... handing land over to Palestinians doesn't bring peace, it brings catastrophe... This formula that the West is obsessed with, of land-for-peace simply doesn't work.\"\nIf the right wins the election, Mr Bennett is certain to be back in the cabinet where he would be a sceptical voice against any international diplomatic manoeuvring to get the two sides back to the negotiating table.\nThe Palestinian people of the West Bank and Gaza of course have no vote in Israel elections - although a small number in East Jerusalem who have applied successfully for Israeli citizenship are an exception to that rule.\nBut the Arab population of Israel itself - descendants of those who remained after the fighting in Israel's War of Independence in 1948-49 - does have the right to vote.\nIt makes up about about 15% of the electorate and that proportion will rise as its young people reach voting age.\nThe three traditional Arab parties have combined into a unified list which is hoping to raise the turnout in that community.\nAnd if they succeed, one of their candidates Aida Touma Suleiman told me, they intend to put the peace process back on the national agenda - not least because they see a clear link between economic and security issues.\n\"This should be the centre of the campaign,\" Ms Suleiman said. \"There's no issue you can discuss without making a connection to the continuation of the occupation and war policy that different governments have led in the last few years.\n\"If you want to talk about housing you need solutions that come with resources and then you should ask where the resources are in this country.\"\nOver the course of the campaign, though, those kind of connections have not dominated the national debate here.\nHow quickly the issue re-asserts itself will depend on whether victory goes to the left or to the right.",

    "The concept will be known as Vulcan, and it is expected to start operations in 2019.\nUnited Launch Alliance - the joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin - currently flies the Atlas and Delta rockets.\nThese are routinely used to loft Nasa science probes, spy satellites and other US national security missions.\nIn time, both vehicles will be retired as the new Vulcan components come on stream.\nThe first element to be introduced will be the first-stage booster, which will feature an all-new, all-American liquid-fuelled engine.\nThis will enable ULA to end its use of Russian-made RD-180 rocket motors \u2013 something Congress has mandated.\nPoliticians on Capitol Hill dislike the fact that American national security missions are launched with the aid of Russian propulsion technology.\nULA's preference is to incorporate a liquid methane-oxygen power unit currently being developed by Blue Origin, the space company run by Amazon entrepreneur Jeff Bezos.\nWhen the new Vulcan booster makes its debut, it will initially be married to the current Centaur upper-stage of the Atlas.\nBut early in the 2020s, this too will be replaced by a bespoke upper-stage that should give the new rocket a performance that allows it to exceed even the Delta IV Heavy \u2013 the biggest, most powerful rocket in the world today, capable of putting upwards of 25 tonnes in a low-Earth orbit.\nCritically, though, the Vulcan will be substantially cheaper to build and operate.\n\"A Delta IV Heavy at today\u2019s launch rates costs about $400m, give or take, depending on the mission and its complexity. I fully expect the Next Generation Launch System to be less than half that,\" said Tory Bruno, president and CEO of United Launch Alliance.\nSome cost savings will be made by recovering and reusing the engines on the first-stage booster following a flight.\nThe idea is that after separation from the upper-stage, the engines would detach from the propellant tanks and fall back to Earth, deploying an inflatable shield to protect them from burning up on re-entry into the atmosphere.\nParachutes would then deploy and a helicopter would swoop in to pluck the engines out of the air and return them safely to the ground for servicing and re-integration into a new booster.\nULA will not say how much the Vulcan development programme is costing, but it will run into the billions of dollars.\nULA has to modernise, however. The priority status it has enjoyed with government contracts is coming to an end, and it is facing increasingly stiff competition \u2013 at home, from a bullish SpaceX company, whose low-cost rockets are winning favour with Nasa and commercial satellite operators; and abroad, where Europe and Russia are both moving to new-generation rocket systems that aim to reduce their launch prices also.",

    "In a series of Freedom of Information requests, BBC Scotland asked how many cases, concerns and complaints of child exploitation, and child sexual exploitation were recorded in the past four years.\nBut the force said the figures were not held on a single system.\nScotland's Children's Commissioner said the revelation was \"disturbing\".\nIt comes on the day that officers launched a new unit to help with what police acknowledge is the complex problem of child abuse and neglect across Scotland.\nIt will provide expertise to allow local teams to robustly investigate cases, including child sexual exploitation, online offences and other types of abuse.\nIn its response to the BBC's FOI requests, Police Scotland said: \"Child exploitation covers a broad range of criminal activity and doesn't correlate to a specific offence, but rather can involve a range of differing offences...The level of data you have requested is not held on a single system.\"\nIt comes after the publication last summer of the Jay report into sexual exploitation in Rotherham in South Yorkshire.\nIt revealed that more than 1,400 children were subjected to appalling sexual abuse.\nLast year Glasgow City Council said 97 children in the city were victims, or at risk of, sexual exploitation.\nThe Association of Chief Police Officers said most forces in England and Wales now put a marker on such offences in their records, but senior officers here say that it is not easy to do.\nChildren's Commissioner Tam Baillie said: \"I am disturbed that we do not yet collect police figures on children who are the subject of sexual exploitation.\n\"This was a recommendation of the Scottish Parliament and features in the Scottish government action plan on child sexual exploitation.\n\"The reason this is so important is that unless we know the scope of the problem we are trying to deal with, then we won't have the appropriate or proportionate response.\"\nAssistant Chief Constable Malcolm Graham, from Police Scotland, said the nature of child sexual exploitation made it highly unlikely that young people would come forward to report being abused.\n\"Our priority is to be focussing on identifying as many victims as we can and identifying perpetrators who have the intent to commit these devastating crimes so we can prevent the abuse from happening,\" he said.\n\"Scotland is at the forefront of approaches to child sexual exploitation.\n\"Sexual exploitation is a form of abuse and it is not a specific crime type recorded as such. Children and young people may be victim of repeated rapes, physical assaults or grooming offences and we categorise all of these in crime recording.\"\nHe added: \"But what is most important here is our focus on identifying who these victims are.\n\"Our focus is always on where there are child protection issues, and on keeping children safe.\"\nMartin Crewe, director of Barnardo's Scotland, said: \"Rotherham was a real wake-up call and led to the Scottish government's national action plan last year but we could and should be doing more.\n\"Our concern is that we don't know the full extent of the problem. We welcome the work of the police.\n\"Since the publication of the Barnardo's Scotland petition in 2011 we have been pushing for a better understanding of child sexual exploitation in Scotland.\"\nIn January 2013, Aileen Campbell, Minister for Children and Young People, responded to the Public Petitions Committee inquiry into Child Sexual Exploitation in Scotland, and announced four points including, action \"to improve the way child sexual exploitation is identified by Scotland's new single police force to make this form of abuse more visible\".\nHowever, sexual exploitation per se is still not recorded or centrally collated.\nThe Scottish government said figures are available on the wider problem of child abuse.\nA spokeswoman said: \"The safety of our children is a key priority for the government and an issue we take extremely seriously.\n\"The launch of the National Child Abuse Investigation Unit will help to target and bring to justice those who seek to harm our young people.\n\"The unit has been set up to tackle all forms of child abuse, and child sexual exploitation is one aspect of this. We have robust legislation in place to cover a wide range of these offences, including online abuse and are working to strengthen the law even further.\"\nShe added: \"The extent of the problem is often difficult to assess because abuse by its very nature is concealed. That's why prevention and swift action to safeguard children are a big part of our strategy to tackle these terrible crimes.\n\"This includes robust National Child Protection guidance, action to tackle emerging forms of child abuse including child sexual exploitation, a national public awareness campaign and guidance for night-time workers such as taxi drivers and hotel staff who may come into contact with those at risk.\"",

Telecom giant Telstra Qantas and PricewaterhouseCoopers have signed an open letter urging the conservative government to consider the economic benefits of reform.\nThey have been joined by the nation's biggest banks, ANZ, the Commonwealth and Westpac, along with retailer David Jones.\nThe letter states:  \"Not only is marriage equality the only truly fair option, but it's also a sound economic option given that a happy workforce is a productive one.\n\"To remain competitive, and to attract top talent from around the world, organisations - and nations - must create a fair and respectful environment for all.\"\nAlex Greenwich, an openly gay member of the New South Wales parliament and a former businessman, who ran a recruitment agency before entering politics, believes that employees who are happy and respected at work are more productive.\n\"There have been so many studies done on the importance of diversity within the workplace and the importance of accepting and treating your staff well in the workplace.\n\"It's kind of a no-brainer,\" says Mr Greenwich, who believes it is time for Australia to shed its reputation for sexual intolerance.\n\"We know that gay and lesbian people are out and open in very senior levels in a number of corporates across the world, and a lot of them are now saying why do we want to go to a country where we'll be treated as a second-class citizen?\"\nThe importance of the so-called 'pink dollar' is felt around in the world where reform has been embraced.\nBut this has done little to soften those opposed to change, who argue that any alterations to Australia's marriage laws would be a backward step.\n\"I think it is disappointing when we have big business trying to influence governments, and for big business to use their clout in this way is intimidating,\" says Wendy Francis, the Queensland director for the Australian Christian Lobby.\n\"What is good for the economy is stable families and that is what we are really wanting to protect in Australia.\"\nBills to allow gay Australians to marry have been rejected by parliamentarians in the past, and there is currently no legislative timetable for further debate in Canberra.\nThe conservative Prime Minister Tony Abbott has deep-seated religious objections, although opinion polls have suggested a majority of voters would be in favour of marriage equality.\nWhile there is resistance at a federal level, laws now exist in New South Wales, Tasmania, Queensland, and Victoria, as well as the Australian Capital Territory that legally recognise same-sex unions.\nTwo years ago, New Zealand became the first country in the Asia-Pacific region to legalise same-sex marriages, and the architects of change believe it has had a transformative effect.\n\"All gay and lesbian people that I encounter are holding their heads just a wee bit higher because they know that the law no longer distinguishes between them and our heterosexual counterparts in this area at least,\" says Kevin Hague, a Green Party MP, who worked on marriage equality campaign.\n\"I know that popular wedding destinations like Queenstown and Rotorua have had a real boom time with same-sex couples from Australia coming over the get married here.\"",

But I have to say something realistic.\"\nMcLaren have not won a race since 2012 and their last championship victory was in 2008.\nBut, in an exclusive interview with BBC Sport, Boullier said they and Honda can make significant strides in performance over the course of this season towards their ultimate goal of winning the world title together.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nHe said: \"Let's say by the second part of the season after the summer break we are at all the races comfortably in the top-10 qualifying shoot-out and fighting for big points - I'm not saying the podium. That for me would be a big, big achievement.\"\nThe Frenchman described the team's troubled pre-season testing programme as a \"disaster\" but insisted the team's recovery plan was now \"falling into place\".\nBoullier revealed:\n-The progress the team are making with both chassis and Honda engine\n-Why Fernando Alonso is happy despite the team's poor performance\n-The extent of the task faced by Honda on their return to F1\nBoullier declined to give an exact answer when asked how the performance gap between McLaren and Mercedes is split between car and engine, although he admits that both need considerable work.\nHonda started working on its new turbo hybrid F1 engine only two years ago, while Mercedes has been developing its since 2010.\nQuestioned on the wisdom of Honda entering this season after such little development time, Boullier says: \"Everyone can have their opinion about the strategy but you can understand why there is so much potential to unlock and why the more mature the project will be, the more we will catch up.\"\nOne anecdote from inside the team reveals just how far behind its rivals Honda is.\nEarly in the season, the McLaren would stutter badly as it was pulling out of the garage, leaving intermittent tyre marks as it did so.\nThis was because Honda's litany of problems meant its engineers had not had the chance to develop a separate programme for the launch settings in the garage, compared to the start of the race.\nBoullier says he and McLaren chairman Ron Dennis intervened because it made such a bad impression.\n\"Ron and I actually asked the engineers to set up a map to get out of the garage to stop the car looking agonising, stupidly pulling away,\" Boullier says.\n\"It is not good to see your car going - cough, cough, cough. Look at the other cars, they pull away nicely. So you have to do it.\"\nHe denies rumours that this made the actual race start in Bahrain less than optimal because there had not been time to do two new maps.\nHonda started the season with an engine that was unreliable and something over 200bhp down on power at the first race in Australia.\nBut Boullier says the engine has improved by \"50%\" since then.\nThat would put the latest Honda in the region of 110bhp down on the standard-setting Mercedes engine at last weekend's Spanish Grand Prix.\nCalculating on the basis of the established lap-time offset for engine power, that suggests that of the 3.1-second gap in qualifying between Mercedes and McLaren in Barcelona, about 1.7-1.8secs is down to the engine.\nFollowing two poor cars in 2013 and 2014, Boullier made major structural changes inside McLaren over the last year.\nMcLaren have moved away from chasing peak downforce towards a more consistent, stable aerodynamic design, an approach led by ex-Red Bull head of aerodynamics Peter Prodromou, now McLaren's chief engineer.\nBoullier has been bullish about the progress McLaren have made as a result, saying that \"performance-wise we are much better\".\nAsked to quantify that statement, he says: \"I don't know, to be honest. Let's say at least the same, which is not bad for a completely new concept.\"\n\"It is much easier to drive, which allows the driver to go to the limit of the car, while last year they couldn't.\"\nBearing in mind the engine-performance deficit, though, McLaren do indeed appear to have made significant progress with the car.\nLast year, taking into account they had the Mercedes engine, the chassis alone was about two seconds off the pace for much of the year. Now, the deficit seems to be not far off half that.\nMcLaren's gap to pole position reduced by about one percentage point at each of the first four races - from 105.9% in Australia to 102.7% in Bahrain.\nThey made a breakthrough at the last race in Spain, where both cars made it out of first qualifying and Alonso and team-mate Jenson Button qualified 13th and 14th. That followed Alonso getting the car into the second knock-out part of qualifying for the first time in Bahrain at the preceding race.\nHowever, McLaren's percentage gap to pole position actually increased in Spain -to 103.7%.\nBoullier says the explanation for this is that other teams took to Barcelona bigger upgrade packages than McLaren, describing the major bodywork revisions on the Ferrari as \"a B-spec car\".\n\"Aerodynamically we are still immature, so we have much more performance coming in the next races,\" Boullier said, adding that Honda had not yet used any of its available performance-related 'tokens' ascribed to engine developments.\nMcLaren made a significant statement of intent in signing Alonso last year - and the Spaniard, still regarded by many as the most complete driver on the grid, took a big risk in joining them.\nAlonso chose to leave Ferrari two years before the end of his contract because he had lost faith they could challenge for the title before the end of 2016.\nSo when his replacement Sebastian Vettel won the second race of the season, many concluded Alonso had made a bad career choice.\nBut the two-time champion insists he has no regrets, and says he left because he \"did not want to finish second for another two years\". This week he went as far as to say \"nothing has changed\" at Ferrari after Vettel finished 46 seconds behind race-winner Nico Rosberg in Spain.\nBoullier says Alonso's peace of mind is not just a public face, adding that the driver is \"relieved to have ended a story [at Ferrari] that was very energy-consuming - not winning, getting frustrated for many reasons\".\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nHe points out that Alonso has referred to his childhood attraction to the first iteration of McLaren-Honda, which dominated F1 from 1988-91, and what he sees as \"unfinished business\" with McLaren, whom he left on bad terms after a tumultuous season together in 2007.\nBoullier says: \"He loves this brand and this team. Obviously Ferrari was special for him, like any driver. But he had a special affection for McLaren.\n\"Then on the professional level, we are very transparent. The drivers are listened to. We don't lie to them, which is very important. They are trusted and they trust us, and that is a big difference with any other team.\n\"So he knows what we are doing. He trusts where we are going and he knows the quality of the people.\"\nAlonso is earning an annual salary of $40m (\u00a326.6m) on a three-year deal until 2017.\nButton, though, is on what is called a \"one-plus-one\" deal - this year, with an option on McLaren's side to retain him for 2016 - and has taken a pay cut from $15m (\u00a310m) to $10m (\u00a36.7m).\nBoullier says he is not surprised that Button has matched Alonso in qualifying so far this year.\n\"People consider Fernando as one of the best drivers and they are right,\" he says. \"But it is underestimating Jenson a little bit.\n\"When he was team-mates with Lewis Hamilton, he was matching Lewis's pace, won against him, sometimes out-qualified him.\n\"Jenson is a great driver and there is a very good working relationship between them. I was very careful at the beginning to not have any stress between them. Today, they respect each other. They work for the team and the team works for them, and it's fine.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\n\"From that balance you can see both are talented enough to match each other and emulate each other a little bit.\"\nBut Boullier will not say whether this has changed anything about 2016, for which the team also have as options reserve driver Kevin Magnussen and their under-contract and highly rated GP2 championship leader Stoffel Vandoorne.\n\"There is no plan, no discussion so far,\" Boullier says.",

    "We've learned a lot about the end of the journey, the slave camps and mass graves in the jungles of Thailand and Malaysia.\nWhat we haven't heard so much about is how these journeys begin.\nWe travelled to southern Bangladesh, where many of the migrants set off on their perilous voyages.\nWhat we have discovered brings a shocking new dimension to this story that speaks of the terrible desperation that is driving this vast movement of people.\nWe met one of the people smugglers on what Bangladeshis proudly boast is the world's longest beach - a vast stretch of sand that runs for more than 120km along the southern coast.\nLet's call him Kamrul Rahman.\nHe appeared to be in his early 30s.  He said he used to be a fisherman and started in the people smuggling racket greedy for money after his business went belly up.\nAs the surf crashed down on the beach beside us, he calmly explained in chilling detail how the business worked.\nHe said the prison camps were an essential part of the business model and all the migrants knew about them.\nIt seems they are part of what amounts to a sinister and hideously cynical marketing trick the people smugglers have evolved: they offer the voyage for virtually no upfront cost.\nHe said the deal was straightforward and understood by everyone involved. You only pay the main charge - about \u00c2\u00a31,500 ($2,300) when you arrive in southern Thailand.\nI was amazed. \"So the migrants know they will be held in camp before they get to Malaysia?\" I asked.\n\"Before they leave from here we tell them if they don't pay they will be put in a prison. You won't get any rice and you will die of hunger\", he told me, without any sign of emotion.\n\"If you pay, you will be able to start for Malaysia with honour.\"\nWe spoke to many migrants and relatives of migrants in southern Bangladesh.\nThey all confirmed his account. Without exception, they said they knew migrants would be held in Thailand until full payment was made.\nWhat this suggests is that for the most part this phenomenon isn't strictly human trafficking - where people are bought and sold against their will - but rather a perverted business transaction to which most of the migrants and their families are actually party.\nThe so-called \"ransoms\" migrants who have been rescued from the camps in Thailand say their captors are actually part of the deal they sign up to when they make the journey.\nTake a moment now to think about what that tells us about the people who make these journeys.\nThey are so desperate for a better life that they are willing to go with the people smugglers even though they know that they may end up starving to death in a jungle prison camp.\nStina Ljungdell, the UN refugee agency representative in Bangladesh, agrees that many migrants do know what they are getting into.\nIf you think about it objectively, it makes a kind of sick business sense for both the smugglers and their customers.\nThe migrants are assured that they only pay the full cost if they actually arrive in Thailand - cash on delivery, if you like.\nMeanwhile, the smugglers have leverage to guarantee that they get paid.\nThe model has the added advantage, from the perspective of the smugglers at least, of making the decision to attempt the trip much easier.\nIt seems many young men, and it is predominantly young men who seem to make the journey, are lured in the risky and selfish hope that their family will find a way raise the money once they arrive in Thailand.\nBut other migrants make the decision to leave together with their families, judging that it is the only way to lift them out of poverty.\nWe were told that a successful migrant can send as much as 30,000 taka (\u00c2\u00a3260/$400) back to his family each month.\nBut many, many migrants don't make it.\nWithin minutes of arriving in an unofficial camp for Rohingya refugees further up the coast, I was surrounded by parents showing me pictures of their missing sons (and occasionally daughters).\nSome said their sons had left for Malaysia without telling them. Many others, however, said they had sent them off in the hope that they would send money back for the family.\nAccording to the smuggler, one in five of the migrants he takes don't make it to Malaysia.\nMany die before they even reach the camps, he told me.\n\"Some die because of the suffering, some die because of of tension, some die thinking about how to escape from the situation and some people die of hunger after they run out of food.\n\"All people have to die\", he said, \"that is fate.\"",

The deaths have prompted an EU effort to boost naval patrols off Libyan waters.\nThe rescued migrants are brought ashore to centres throughout Italy, where they are expected to remain until their claims for asylum within the EU have been processed.\nSpeaking to reporters after the G7 summit in Germany, Mr Renzi said the EU had to acknowledge that its current system for dealing with migrants was not working.\n\"What we need to do at the moment is solve problems, not by shouting but through action,\" he said.\nHe also urged the EU to take in more refugees from Italy, saying a recent plan to relocate 24,000 refugees to other European countries was \"not enough\".\nThe influx has put a severe strain on Italy's asylum infrastructure, and has fuelled support for right-wing politicians who oppose immigration.\nOn Sunday, the president of Lombardy, Roberto Maroni, said his region would not take in any more migrants.

I lead a unique team of volunteers, including our trustees, who have supported so many families through their cancer ordeal.\"",

    "An unsolicited email from Apple inviting publishers to join the service presumes acceptance of the terms, unless they actively opt out.\nIt requires them to cover Apple if legal issues arise, among other things.\nApple, which is due to launch the app later this year, refused to comment on the row.\nThe terms read: \"If we receive a legal claim about your RSS content, we will tell you so that you can resolve the issue, including indemnifying Apple if Apple is included in the claim.\"\nAgreement to that, and other terms, is a prerequisite for being included in the forthcoming app.\nHowever, a line in the email from Apple made clear that publishers not wishing to be bound by them would be expected to say so explicitly.\nThat has led some to express concern that they would be bound by the agreement perhaps without ever having seen it or actively consenting to it.\nOther terms in the email allow Apple to place adverts next to publishers' publicly available content without paying them.\nThe BBC has spoken to three online publishers about the move.\nOne of them, Mike Ash said he thought it was \"wrong of Apple\" to presume that he would indemnify them. He said the email was \"presumptuous\".\nAnd, in a blogpost entitled I Do Not Agree To Your Terms, he took issue with the requirement to opt out.\nHe wrote: \"Let me get this straight, Apple: you send me an email outlining the terms under which you will redistribute my content, and you will just assume that I agree to your terms unless I opt out?\n\"You're going to consider me bound to terms you just declared to me in an email as long as I don't respond? That's completely crazy. You don't even know if I received the email!\"\nAccording to Graham Hann, the head of technology, media and communications at the law firm Taylor Wessing, the terms of the deal are broadly in line with industry standards - except the requirement to opt out.\n\"The content of the notice is not unusual, although it has deliberately been dumbed down, possibly for clarity,\" he told the BBC.\n\"However, the optout approach is very unusual and I don't see how the notice could form a binding contract without a positive reply.\n\"Apple clearly wants to launch with as much content as possible and has taken this risk-based approach. Some publishers may object and even threaten to sue.\n\"However, I think it would be hard to claim damage beyond a reasonable royalty fee.\"\nApple will place the publishers' content via a publicly available RSS feed, which sends any updates to a blog or website to the host - in this case, Apple News.\nPublishers make these feeds publicly available voluntarily.\nAfter announcing the launch of the app, the company began advertising for editorial staff to work on it, indicating that it would be curated by a human editor, rather than an algorithm.\nThe news app is categorised as part of the firm's marketing department.\nIt is due to be launched with the latest operating system update - iOS9 - later in 2015.\nApple also announced at the WWDC developers' conference that it was launching a music streaming app that would include the user's music video library, as well as an internet radio station and a way for artists to share unreleased tracks.",
    "Irish ministers have said they want the UK to stay in the EU and will not stay neutral in the forthcoming referendum.\nThe UK is the Irish Republic's largest trading partner, with one billion euros in weekly trade between the countries.\nDublin has begun contingency planning in case the UK chooses to leave.\nAhead of Mr Kenny's visit to Downing Street, Ireland's Public Expenditure and Reform Minister Brendan Howlin said there were serious concerns about the possibility of a UK exit and Ireland would express its views clearly on the referendum, which will take place some time before the end of 2017.\n\"I think probably for the first time ever it will be our business because it will have a direct and significant impact on Ireland and the Irish people and we certainly will be expressing our views on that,\" he said.\n\"By tradition we don't involve ourselves in domestic issues - for example in the Scottish referendum the Irish government was entirely silent - but on this matter I don't think the Irish government or indeed the Irish Parliament will be silent.\"\nEurope minister Dara Murphy said the government's current strategy was to try to help David Cameron in his efforts to change the terms of the UK's EU membership.\nHe would not be drawn on Ireland's attitude to Mr Cameron's key demands, saying he had yet to see specific proposals on the table, but he told the BBC that his government had \"some concerns\".\n\"I think the best way of dealing with our concern is for our Taoiseach Enda Kenny meeting with David Cameron, by me and others engaging with our opposite numbers, and by talking to people in the UK and saying, 'the European Union is imperfect but we're far better off with it than without it'.\n\"It's in nobody's interest to step outside.\"\nFormer Prime Minister Bertie Ahern was a key figure in the Northern Ireland peace process, working alongside Tony Blair to help bring about the Good Friday Agreement.\nHe says it would be \"senseless\" for the UK to leave the EU and it would have profound implications for Northern Ireland, jeopardising much of the economic investment so vital to the efforts to resolve outstanding differences.\nHe said: \"You can just imagine the difficulties caused if we were to go 100 kilometres up the road and you were to find a region that was not part of the European Union. The farmers in the North very much are supportive of the Common Agricultural Policy; merchandise, goods and services from the North are mainly into Europe. It would be senseless.\n\"And, in fact, I think it would probably be the only time we'd get all the parties in the North voting the same way. It would be going back light years, you would be going back to old times, which would be hugely negative.\"\nMany business are worried too.\nSean O'Driscoll, the chief executive of Glen Dimplex, says the UK referendum is already creating uncertainty at a time when his business, which claims to be the biggest heating manufacturer in the world, needs to make key decisions about its future operations.\nDavid Cameron is starting renegotiation of the terms of Britain's EU membership ahead of a referendum. Here is some further reading on what it all means:\nQ&A: The UK's planned EU referendum\nUK and the EU: Better off out or in?\nWhat Britain wants from Europe\nTimeline: EU referendum debate\nAbout 30% of the Dublin-based company's turnover is in the UK, where it employs 3,500 people.\nHe told me it would be \"catastrophic\" if the UK was to leave the EU and it would have serious implications for his business, its employees, suppliers and customers.\nEconomists estimate that a British exit from Europe would cost Ireland anything from 2% to 12% of its GDP, depending on the terms of any future arrangements.\nBrian Lucey, professor of finance at Trinity College, said it would be the greatest upheaval for the Irish economy short of a war.\nBut he said there were also potential benefits for Ireland in attracting some of the investment and financial services which are currently drawn to London.\nIt's a scenario the Irish government hopes to avoid, stressing its determination to help the UK to stay in the EU.\nBut when the Irish PM Enda Kenny arrives in London, David Cameron will want to know whether he can count on Ireland's support on the key changes he is seeking to Britain's relationship with the EU.",

    "The world changed on 6 August 1945. Arguably, the appalling effects of that first atomic strike - and the subsequent attack on Nagasaki - have played a large part in the determination to prevent the use of far more devastating weapons developed since.\nBack then, the US was the only nation with \"the bomb\".\nThe story since has been of the steady spread, the proliferation, of nuclear weapons: first to Russia, Britain, France and China - then to Israel (although never officially acknowledged), India, Pakistan, North Korea.\nThe big powers seemed either unable or unwilling to prevent that spread except perhaps now - in the case of Iran.\nAll sorts of conflicting signals are coming out of the international talks in Vienna meant to end all the hostility between the major world powers and Iran over its much disputed nuclear programme. There's talk of both breakdown and possible breakthrough.\nSo why is it judged so important to stop Iran?\nI asked Sir John Sawers, chief British negotiator with Iran from 2003 to 2007, and after that the UK's representative on the UN Security Council when sanctions against Iran were being decided.\nHe said: \"If Iran acquired a nuclear weapon, then it would change the dynamic across the Middle East.\n\"It would make them invulnerable to any response to their unacceptable behaviour in the region.\"\nSir John told me: \"If there is an agreement then, first of all, it gives everyone much greater assurance that Iran is not going to make a break for nuclear weapons.\n\"It opens the possibility of Iran and its Arab neighbours coming together and developing a more normal relationship.\n\"At the moment, the Middle East is riven by disputes - many of them along Sunni-Shia lines - and if we can create a possibility whereby Saudis and Iranians can talk to one another and it is not driven by continuous hostility, then there is a possibility of creating a different sort of Middle East.\"\nIt's not just August 1945 which hangs heavy over the negotiations with Iran.\nThe events of February 1979 in Iran itself, and everything which has followed, help explain the years of suspicion and outright hostility between Tehran and Washington which a nuclear deal could do so much to ease.\nAyatollah Khomeini's triumphant return to Tehran - on 1 February 1979 - from exile in Paris to take power as supreme leader of an Islamic Republic symbolises the moment when the US and its allies lost control of Iran with the fall of the shah.\nThe years of blatant Western interference were over.\nRuhollah Khomeini was born in Kohmeyn in central Iran. He became a religious scholar and in the early 1920s rose to become an 'ayatollah', a term for a leading Shia scholar.\nArrested in 1962 by the shah's security service for his outspoken opposition to the pro-Western regime of the Shah. His arrest elevated him to the status of national hero.\nExiled in 1964, living in Turkey, Iraq and then France, from where he urged his supporters to overthrow the shah.\nIn January 1979, the shah's government collapsed and he and his family fled into exile. On 1 February, Khomeini returned to Iran in triumph.\nThere was a national referendum and Khomeini won a landslide victory. He declared an Islamic republic and was appointed Iran's political and religious leader for life.\nIslamic law was introduced across the country.\nThe new religious leadership inherited a nuclear research programme, but consistently denies expanding it with the aim of making \"the bomb\".\nThe big powers have never accepted that, pointing instead to all the Iranian effort to produce highly-enriched uranium in the quantities you could only need to build a bomb, as well as the secrecy and alleged concealment of so much activity which is specifically outlawed by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to which Iran is a signatory.\nYears of pressure applied by sanctions and negotiations to find a way forward have now reached a point where agreement could - just could - be possible.\nI spoke to Ariane Tabatabai, of Georgetown University, who, like me, has been in Vienna to follow what is supposed to be the endgame in these talks.\nShe told me: \"Ultimately, the negotiations are about making sure that Iran's nuclear programme remains peaceful and to do that it needs to provide a set of assurances and that would mean Iran scaling back some of its nuclear activities.\n\"It will also provide more transparency to the International Atomic Energy Agency to make sure that everything is essentially under constant monitoring, with enhanced access given to its facilities so the international community can verify that Iran is holding its end of the bargain.\"\nWhich brings us neatly to the unanswerable question: Is the Iranian leadership ready to make a bargain?\nIt could be, partly to pacify those Iranians fed up with sanctions which help cripple their economy and symbolise isolation from a fast-developing world they yearn to be part of.\nProfessor Ali Ansari, historian of Iran at St Andrews University, pointed me to another of the country's ambitions, which is to recover some of the global respect which Iran believes it is due.\n\"What the Iranians are after is a degree of respect as a country that considers itself a great power - certainly in the region - that has not had a good time in the last century or so.\n\"The real pride and achievement is that they have developed what they've considered to be an indigenous nuclear industry.\n\"One of the arguments many people have made is that an Islamic government wouldn't be scientifically advanced.\n\"Well for the Iranians, you know, this is, sort of proof that it actually can be, if they put their mind to it.\"\nBut Prof Ansari is far from certain that a deal can be done, and - even if it is - that it will hold.\nAnd Sir John, from all his years negotiating with Iran, is blunt: \"Whenever you buy a carpet in Iran, you have to buy it two, three times over.\n\"You sometimes feel that is the same in the nuclear negotiations as well. There is an Iranian saying that the real negotiation only begins once the agreement is signed.\n\"They will always come back for more. Even if we get an agreement - it doesn't mean it is 'peace in our time'.\"\nSo suspicion on both sides remains strong.\nWhatever happens in the next few days, building and then maintaining trust between Iran and the key world powers, particularly the US, is still the toughest of all the challenges.",
    "Victory in the Cold War made it the hegemon in a unipolar world.\nFew argued when the 20th Century was dubbed the \"American Century\", a term first coined in the early 1940s when the country was still overcoming its isolationist instincts.\nEven the New Year's fireworks, which illuminated the obelisk of the Washington Monument in a way that made it resemble a giant number one, projected the country's supremacy as the world's sole superpower.\nOver the past 15 years, America's fortunes have changed with dizzying speed.\nFirst came the tremors: the dot-com bust and a disputed presidential election in 2000. Then came the massive convulsions: the destruction of the Twin Towers in 2001 and the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008.\nLong wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have exacted an enormous blood price - the lives of 6,852 American military personnel - not to mention immense financial expense, estimated to be as high as $6 trillion (\u00c2\u00a33.9tn).\nThe detention centre at Guantanamo Bay has undermined American ideals, just as the NSA and Wikileaks spying scandals have undercut American diplomacy.\nGeorge W Bush, a president with a Manichean worldview, was widely seen as over-eager to project America's military might, without adequately considering the long-term consequences.\nBarack Obama, who campaigned in 2008 on a platform of extricating America from its unpopular and exhausting wars, has drawn criticism for disengaging too much.\nUnder both presidents - the first an impulsive unilateralist, the second an instinctive multilateralist content sometimes to lead from behind - America's global standing has been diminished.\nPolls regularly show that Americans recognise that their country's international standing has waned.\nAmong the young, this trendline has fallen sharply. Only 15% of 18-29-year-olds believe that America is the \"greatest country in the world\", according to Pew, down from 27% in 2011.\nTellingly, however, there has been no great public outcry.\nNo longer is there much appetite for America playing its long-standing role of global policeman, even in the face of the rise of the group calling itself Islamic State.\nThe cost, human and financial, is considered too great. Americans increasingly think that other countries should share the burden.\nObama, while continuing to trumpet \"American exceptionalism\", regularly prefaces remarks on foreign affairs by acknowledging the limits of US power, again with little public outcry.\nThe upshot is that the United States is no longer so keen to exert leadership in an increasingly messy world.\nYet one of the reasons why the world has become so disorderly is because America is no longer so active in imposing order.\nOver the course of this century Washington has lost its fear factor.\nWorld leaders nowadays seem prepared to provoke the wrath of the White House, confident that it will never rain down on them.\nIt explains why the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, after unleashing chemical weapons against his people, continues to bombard them with barrel bombs.\nWhy Vladimir Putin annexed Crimea, and also offered a safe haven for the NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden.\nAnd also why Benjamin Netanyahu thumbed his nose at the Obama administration, by accepting an invitation from the Republican congressional leadership to address a joint session of Congress, a platform he used to lambast the Iran nuclear deal.\nAssad's flouting of American warnings is especially noteworthy.\nIn killing so many civilians with chemical weapons, he flagrantly crossed the \"red line\" imposed by Obama, but escaped punishment.\nThe president was unwilling to carry through on an explicit threat, in what was the biggest foreign policy climbdown of his presidency and also one of the most significant in the past 50 years.\nEven supporters of Barack Obama believe he made a fatal strategic mistake, because it demonstrated endless flexibility and a lack of American resolve.\nNeedless to say, despots around the world took note.\nAmerica's reluctance to launch new military actions has also had a major bearing on the nuclear negotiations with Iran.\nTehran has managed to extract notable concessions, such as the ongoing ability to enrich uranium, hitherto ruled out by the Americans.\nIt has played a weak hand strongly, because it knows that America has what the foreign affairs columnist Thomas Friedman calls \"an empty holster\".\nNor is it just America's enemies who no longer fear the White House to the extent they once did.\nIn recent months, two close allies, Britain and Australia, have defied the Obama administration by joining the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.\nBy signing up to the AIIB, they are effectively endorsing Beijing's effort to establish financial rivals to the Bretton Woods institutions, the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF), which are dominated by America.\nBy seeking improved commercial and diplomatic relations with China, Britain and Australia are also hedging.\nThey suspect that America will not be the dominant Pacific military power indefinitely, nor the world's foremost economic powerhouse.\nOther American allies would complain that the \"dependability factor\" has also gone.\nIsrael feels badly let down by the Obama administration over the Iran deal, and relations between Benjamin Netanyahu and Barack Obama are poisonous.\nThe president, by using deliberately ambiguous language, has even signalled that his administration might end its traditional protection of Israel at the United Nations.\nLike Israel, Saudi Arabia has been enraged by the prospective nuclear deal with the Iranians.\nRiyadh also knows that America is no longer so dependent on its oil, the cornerstone of the relationship since the end of World War Two.\nEgypt was angered in 2012 when Obama said Cairo was neither an ally nor an enemy.\nLater, the State Department issued an embarrassing correction, and reinstated Cairo as a \"major non-Nato ally.\"\nMaybe Obama's Egyptian error, and the slight it conveyed, was truly a Freudian slip.\nAfter all, he hasn't invested the same energy nurturing alliances as his predecessors. The detached air that has been a hallmark of his presidency also extends to foreign affairs.\nHere, I gather, Obama recognises intellectually that he could do far more in terms of massaging the egos of world leaders, but cannot quite bring himself to do so.\nIndeed, a common complaint is that the Obama administration has prioritised normalising relations with its one-time enemies, Iran and Cuba, at the expense of fostering longstanding friendships.\nRealising that America is no longer so supportive, and no longer so engaged in the Middle East, the Saudis have recently taken military action of their own in Yemen.\nThere's also been a warming of relations between Riyadh and Moscow.\nAnd Egypt launched airstrikes in February against the Islamic State group in Libya.\nAmerica's standing in the Middle East has unquestionably waned, along with its ability to shape events.\nMore surprising has been its slippage in Africa, Obama's ancestral home, and Asia, the focus of his much vaunted pivot.\nIn Asia, America's median approval rating in 2014, as measured by Gallup, was 39%, a 6% drop since 2011.\nIn Africa, the median approval went down to 59%, the lowest since polling began, despite Obama hosting the US-Africa Leaders' Summit in Washington in August, last year.\nIt even dropped in Kenya, his father's birthplace.\nAmerica's diplomacy has also been complicated by the dysfunction and hyper-partisanship in Washington.\nRepublican lawmakers actively sought to derail the Iran nuclear deal by sending a letter to the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\nHouse speaker John Boehner invited Netanyahu to address Congress, knowing it would infuriate the White House.\nDemocrats with reservations about free trade have tried to sabotage the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the biggest trade deal since Nafta.\nThere's also been strong congressional opposition to one of the big plays of Obama's second term, the rapprochement with Cuba.\nShould countries listen to the president or Congress?\nAmerica cannot even lay claim any more to its great, uncontested boast since 1872, of being the world's largest economy.\nThe IMF now estimates that China's economy is fractionally bigger.\nYet it would be a mistake to exaggerate the downsizing of American influence.\nUS military spending continues to dwarf its rivals, and up until last year amounted to more than the next 10 countries combined.\nIn 2014, America spent $731bn, compared to China's $143bn.\nEven though China's economy is now larger, America's per capita spending power is in a different league - $53,000 to $11,868.\nThough America is contending with the rise of the rest - China, India, Brazil, Germany and Russia - it has not yet been overtaken by emergent rivals.\nIndeed, there are foreign policy thinkers here who predict that America will preserve its pre-eminence for at least another 20 years.\nYet the unipolar moment ushered in by the fall of the Berlin Wall has proved to be just that: momentary.\nMoreover, hopes of a new world order following the collapse of the Soviet Union have given way to widespread pessimism about the spread, even the contagion, of global disorder.\nGone are the certainties of America's Cold War thinking, when the containment of communism governed its international actions.\nGone are the doctrines that gave US foreign policy such a rigid frame, throughout the Cold War and in the aftermath of 9/11.\nGone, too, is the notion that every fight is an American fight and along with it a redefinition of what constitutes the US national interest.\nBarack Obama has instead advocated pragmatism and diplomatic dexterity, trying to steer a path between America being overextended and undercommitted.\nMaybe the overriding challenge for US diplomacy over the next 20 years is to strike the proper balance.",

I came here to win trophies. I came here to reach some great goals with the team.\n\"It was the right club for me because I had a good chat with the manager and I wanted to be part of his project.\"\nLiverpool struggled for goals last season following the \u00a375m sale of Luis Suarez to Barcelona and prolonged injury absences for England international Daniel Sturridge as they finished sixth in the Premier League.\nSignings Mario Balotelli and Rickie Lambert produced three league goals and, after acknowledging the lack of scoring last season, manager Brendan Rodgers has added Benteke to revive the Reds' attack.\nLiverpool have also signed forwards Danny Ings from Burnley and Brazil international Roberto Firmino from Hoffenheim, while Benteke's international team-mate Divock Origi has returned to the club after spending last season on loan at Lille.\nBenteke missed the 2014 World Cup in Brazil with an Achilles tendon injury but returned to action last October and scored 15 times to help Villa stay in the Premier League and reach the FA Cup final.\nFormer Villa manager Paul Lambert, who brought Benteke into English football, believes he will do well at Anfield.\nLambert told BBC Sport: \"He's a brilliant number nine. He won't need just crosses to come into the box. If he gets the service he'll get goals.\n\"That's the type of guy he is and on his game he's a handful. I'm delighted for him. He's earned that move and if he can do what I think he can do, he'll do great for them.\n\"He's going to have to handle the expectancy level of winning [at Liverpool]. When you speak to Christian, he has a great belief in himself to do well.\"\nFormer Liverpool striker John Aldridge is also excited to see Benteke lead the Liverpool forward line, telling BBC Radio 5 live: \"He gives something different, a massive presence up front.\n\"It's a fallacy when people say he doesn't play the Liverpool way. He knocked Liverpool out of the semi-final of the FA Cup when he played through the middle.\n\"He's very quick, very strong, very aggressive and that's something we haven't had for some time up front. It's something I'm really happy with and I think he'll bring a lot to the squad.\n\"I'm a lot more optimistic than I was this time last year. The strikers only scored eight goals last year, we can only do better than that going forward.\"\nFind all the latest football transfers on our dedicated page.",
    "Kepler-452b orbits at a very similar distance from its star, though its radius is 60% larger.\nMission scientists said they believed it was the most Earth-like planet yet.\nSuch worlds are of interest to astronomers because they might be small and cool enough to host liquid water on their surface - and might therefore be hospitable to life.\nNasa's science chief John Grunsfeld called the new world \"Earth 2.0\" and the \"closest so far\" to our home.\nIt is around 1,400 light years away from Earth.\nJon Jenkins, Kepler data analysis lead at Nasa's Ames Research Center in California, added: \"It's a real privilege to deliver this news to you today. There's a new kid on the block that's just moved in next door.\"\nThe new world joins other exoplanets such as Kepler-186f that are similar in many ways to Earth.\nDetermining which is most Earth-like depends on the properties one considers. Kepler-186f, announced in 2014, is smaller than the new planet, but orbits a red dwarf star that is significantly cooler than our own.\nKepler-452b, however, orbits a parent star which belongs to the same class as the Sun: it is just 4% more massive and 10% brighter. Kepler-452b takes 385 days to complete a full circuit of this star, so its orbital period is 5% longer than Earth's.\nThe mass of Kepler-452b cannot be measured yet, so astronomers have to rely on models to estimate a range of possible masses, with the most likely being five times that of Earth. If it is rocky, the world would likely still have active volcanism and its gravity could be roughly twice that on our own planet.\nThe new world is included in a haul of 500 new possible planets sighted by the Kepler space telescope around distant stars.\nTwelve of the new candidates are less than twice Earth's diameter, orbiting in the so-called habitable zone around their star.\nThis zone refers to a range of distances at which the energy radiated by the star would permit water to exist as a liquid on the planet's surface if certain other conditions are also met.\nOf these 500 candidates, Kepler-452b is the first to be confirmed as a planet.\nDr Suzanne Aigrain, from the University of Oxford, who was not involved with the study, told BBC News: \"I do believe the properties described for Kepler-452b are the most Earth-like I've come across for a confirmed planet to date.\n\"What seems even more significant to me is the number of planets in the habitable zone of their host stars with radii below two Earth radii; 12 is quite a few compared to the pre-existing Kepler planet catalogue.\n\"It bodes well for their attempts to provide a more robust measure of the incidence of Earth-like planets, which is the top-level goal of the Kepler mission.\"\nWhile similar in size and brightness to the Sun, Kepler-452b's host star is 1.5 billion years older than ours. Scientists working on the mission therefore believe it could point to a possible future for the Earth.\n\"If Kepler-452b is indeed a rocky planet, its location vis-a-vis its star could mean that it is just entering a runaway greenhouse phase of its climate history,\" explained Dr Doug Caldwell, a Seti Institute scientist working on the Kepler mission.\n\"The increasing energy from its aging sun might be heating the surface and evaporating any oceans. The water vapour would be lost from the planet forever.\"\n\"Kepler-452b could be experiencing now what the Earth will undergo more than a billion years from now, as the Sun ages and grows brighter.\"\nDr Don Pollacco, from Warwick University, UK, who was not involved with the latest analysis, told the BBC: \"Kepler data allows you to estimate the relative size of a planet to its host star, so if you know the size of the host, hey presto, you know the size of the planet.\n\"However, to go further - i.e. is it rocky? - involves measuring the mass of the planets and this is much more difficult to do as the stars are too far away for these measurements (which are incredibly difficult) to make.\n\"So in reality they have no idea what this planet is made of: It could be rock but it could be a small gassy ball or something more exotic maybe.\"\nDr Chris Watson, from Queen's University Belfast, UK, commented: \"Other Kepler habitable zone planets may well be more Earth-like in this respect. For example, Kepler-186f is approximately 1.17 Earth radii, and Kepler-438b is approximately 1.12 Earth radii.\n\"In fact, at 1.6 Earth radii, this would place Kepler-452b in a category of planet called a 'Super-Earth' - our Solar System does not actually have any planet of this type within it! Super-Earths are hugely interesting for this reason, but one might then say, well, is it really 'Earth-like' given all this?\"\nHe added: \"When we look at the type of star Kepler-452b orbits, then it seems to be a star not too dissimilar to our Sun... The other Kepler habitable zone planets that have been discovered so far tend to be orbiting M-dwarfs - stars far cooler than our Sun, and therefore the planets need to orbit much closer to receive the same levels of heating.\n\"So it may be a potentially rocky super-Earth in an Earth-like orbit (in terms of host star and orbital distance). It's this combination of the host star and orbit that set it apart in my opinion.\"\nThe findings have been accepted for publication in The Astronomical Journal.\nFollow Paul on Twitter.",
    "It comes amid growing concern that the next branch of so-called Islamic State (IS) could emerge in the region.\nDavid Cameron said \"brutal terrorists\" would only be defeated if countries united against their \"common enemy\".\nMr Cameron is to raise the issue in meetings with the leaders of both countries during the four-day trip.\nHe is heading to Indonesia on the first stop of his tour, which is primarily intended to boost trade with Britain.\nBut Mr Cameron will also use his visit to discuss the threat from Islamist extremism with his counterparts, President Joko Widodo of Indonesia, and later Prime Minister Najib Razak of Malaysia.\nThe UK government estimates about 500 people from Indonesia and about 200 from Malaysia have joined IS in Iraq and Syria.\nThe prime minister is said to be \"keen to explore\" whether the UK can offer more practical counter-terrorism support to both countries, such as disrupting foreign fighters, investigating potential terror plots and improving aviation security.\nHe is also planning to learn from their work in tackling the extremist ideology and encouraging tolerance, to explore whether the UK can learn from their approach.\nSpeaking ahead of his departure for Indonesia, Mr Cameron said IS was \"one of the biggest threats our world has faced\".\n\"All of us face a threat from foreign fighters and from increasing radicalisation within our countries and it's right that we look at what help we can provide to one another,\" he said.\nSeparately, it is understood the UK government has had discussions about its role in tackling IS in Libya.\nThere is no suggestion of any air strikes but it is thought the UK has considered what help it could offer in combating IS's presence if a stable Libyan government was formed.",
    "Marie Black, 34, of Norwich, stood trial with nine others, including five women, at Norwich Crown Court.\nBlack denied 26 charges. A jury found her guilty of all but three counts.\nShe was convicted of offences including rape and inciting a child to engage in sexual activity. Two men were found guilty of child sex abuse and another woman was found guilty of assault.\nMichael Rogers, 53, from Romford, was found guilty of 14 counts including cruelty, rape and inciting a child to engage in sexual activity.\nJason Adams, 43, from Norwich, was convicted of 13 similar counts.\nCarol Stadler, 60, from Atkinson Close, Bowthorpe, Norwich, was found guilty of assault causing actual bodily harm but cleared of nine other charges, including serious sexual assaults.\nThey are due to be sentenced on 28 September.\nSix other defendants, Anthony Stadler, 63, Nicola Collins, 36, Andrew Collins, 52, Judith Fuller, 32, Denise Barnes, 34, and Kathleen Adams, 84, all from Norwich, were cleared of all charges.\nBlack sobbed uncontrollably in the dock as the verdicts were delivered.\nOpening the trial, prosecutor Angela Rafferty QC said Black, previously known as Marie Adams, played an instrumental role in using the five children as \"sexual playthings\".\nThe abuse, which is said to have happened in and around Norwich and London, included forcing the children to have sex with one another.\nOn some occasions, the adults threw parties and played card games to decide who would abuse which child, Mrs Rafferty said.\nIn interviews the victims described how they were abused in front of one another and other adults.\nSome of the abuse involved children's toys, including Barbie dolls.\nAll of the defendants denied abusing the children, saying it simply did not happen.\nDuring the trial it emerged police had launched an investigation into the conduct of one agency social worker involved in the case.\nThe court heard that the trial had originally been due to start last year only to be delayed when prosecutors raised concerns over changes made by social workers to statements taken from the children.\nThis resulted in Norfolk Police launching an investigation into anomalies in documents. Prosecutors decided no action should be taken, Norfolk Police said after the trial.\nA police spokeswoman added: \"There was no wrongdoing found on the part of the council.\"\nSheila Lock, interim executive director of children's services at Norfolk County Council, said: \"The victims in this case have shown tremendous courage in speaking out.\n\"The needs of the children, who were central to the prosecution case, have always been at the fore of our minds and have been the main focus of all of the agencies involved.\n\"Our priority continues to be the children in this case who, despite the ordeal they have been through, are now doing well and are safe from harm.\"\nDeanna Neilson, head of safeguarding at Action for Children, said: \"This appalling case reveals the premeditated and organised approach some people take to abusing children.\n\"We cannot lose sight of the needs of the children who suffered at their hands, even though the abuse has stopped.\n\"Children must be supported, and in some cases receive therapy, to ensure they are armed with the confidence and knowledge they need to recover from this trauma.\"",

    "It has been a busy period of transfer activity as teams look to strengthen and build on their previous campaign.\nWith gaps to fill, many clubs have been looking outside of the Scottish border for new talent.\nAlongside club stalwarts and players familiar with the Scottish game, which players will help shape the season?\nCeltic built their title-winning side around a solid foundation at the back last season.\nVirgil van Dijk and Jason Denayer were at the heart of a defence that kept 22 clean sheets in the league. With the latter returning to parent club Manchester City, manager Ronny Deila has been quick to find a replacement.\nDedryck Boyata signed a four-year contract this summer, ending a nine-year stay at Manchester City and the 24-year-old has already looked settled among his new team-mates. A goal on his competitive debut against Stjarnan, followed with the winner on Thursday, helped Celtic secure a 1-0 first leg lead over Qarabag.\nCeltic will be looking for this form to continue as they chase a fifth consecutive title.\nLast season, Aberdeen had their best league campaign since the 1993-94 season as they secured second place. This season, they will be looking to improve on the promising strides they have taken under Derek McInnes.\nThe Dons have strength in depth in most departments, but the acquisition of goalkeeper Danny Ward from Liverpool on a season-long loan looks to have been a smart piece of business.\nMcInnes deployed both Jamie Langfield, 35, and Scott Brown, 30, between the sticks last season, but the early indications seem to point to Ward being given the opportunity to stake a claim to be the club's number one this season.\nImpressive displays in the Europa League qualifiers have strengthened the 22-year-old Welshman's position and he could be a key factor if the Dons are to push Celtic all the way in this season's title race.\nNadir Ciftci's \u00a31.5m departure to Celtic this summer has left Dundee United boss Jackie McNamara with a position to fill in his forward line. McNamara will be hoping that Croatia Under-21 cap Darko Bodul will be the man to do the job.\nAt 26, Bodul has plenty of experience throughout Europe. Beginning his career in his native Austria with First Vienna, Bodul has also had spells with Dutch sides Heerenveen, Ajax and Sparta Rotterdam, as well as stints with Nacional of Portugal, Austrians Sturm Graz and Danish outfit Odense. He left Austrian Bundesliga side Rheindorf Altach at the end of last season.\nBodul made his pre-season debut in a United shirt during the 2-1 defeat by Queens Park Rangers, coming on as a second-half substitute before starting in the 1-0 friendly defeat by Watford, lasting an hour before being replaced. McNamara described his new signing as ''technically gifted, skilful and a penalty box goal scorer\".\nWith some impressive teams on his CV and a two-year contract, United will hope to see the best of Bodul in the coming season.\nHe may have the most famous name in Scottish football, but Dutchman Rodney Sneijder wants to be his own man at Dundee United.\nThe younger brother of Galatasaray midfielder Wesley, Rodney was signed on a two-year deal after his release by Almere City in his homeland. It marks the first time that the 24-year-old midfielder has played for a club outside of the Netherlands.\nHaving begun his career at Ajax, Sneijder will be looking to kick-start his time in Scottish football when the season gets under way. With United looking to rebuild after the recent departures of Gary Mackay-Stevens and Stuart Armstrong to Celtic, it would appear that he will likely get the opportunity to do so.\nSneijder may get his first chance on the opening weekend as his side face Aberdeen at Tannadice this Sunday.\nAfter winning the Championship last season, Hearts will be determined to re-establish themselves as a top-flight club after their season in the second tier.\nRobbie Neilson has conducted a squad overhaul as they look to build upon their title success. The conclusion of Genero Zeefuik's loan spell from Groningen has left a void up front that Neilson will be looking for Juanma Delgado to occupy.\nThe 24-year-old Spaniard joins from Greek Super League outfit Kalloni on a three-year contract. At 6ft 2in, the former Levante youth player will have a presence in the forward line that Neilson will require to meet his ambitions of finishing in the top six this season.\nHe is described by his new manager as \"a good player, technically very good, great in the air and has good link-up play - and he's a great character\".",

    "Mullah Mansour was named as the new leader on Thursday, after the death of former head Mullah Omar was confirmed.\nBut a Taliban spokesman told the BBC he had not been appointed \"by all Taliban\", going against Sharia law.\nThe audio message said fighters should unite as \"division in our ranks will only please our enemies\".\nIt also said that the Taliban would \"continue our jihad until we bring an Islamic rule in the country\".\nThe 30-minute recording - in which a crying baby is heard at some points - was released to journalists by Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid on Saturday.\nThe first public message from the Afghan Taliban's new leader, Mullah Mansour, indicates that his way of doing things will be different from that of his reclusive predecessor, Mullah Omar, who relied on issuing written statements.\nThe recording is of a speech that he made to a gathering of apparently dozens of his supporters, after his appointment on Thursday.\nFaced with opposition to his selection from several high-ranking Taliban, the new leader is now focused on consolidating his power and establishing his authority.\nThe speech repeatedly calls for unity and is primarily aimed at calming dissent.\nMullah Mansour says that his new role is not a \"kingship\" but a huge responsibility.\nHe is also trying to present himself as a tolerant, forgiving and conciliatory person whose decisions will be \"based on Islamic Sharia\". There doesn't seem to be a major policy shift from the past.\nIn his speech, he sounds relaxed and doesn't seem to be reading from notes.\nTaliban leaders 'not consulted'\nSome Taliban figures have accused pro-Pakistani circles of imposing Mullah Mansour, who is known for his support for peace talks, on them.\nBut in the audio message, Mullah Mansour dismissed peace talks as \"propaganda campaigns by the enemy\".\nAt least one Taliban faction would have preferred Mullah Omar to be succeeded by his son.\nAnother Taliban spokesman, Mullah Abdul Manan Niazi, said those who elected Mullah Mansour had not followed the rules.\n\"According to Islamic rule and principles, when a leader dies, a Shura (council) is called, then its leader is appointed,\" he added.",

    "But are there limits to how far authenticity can take a politician?\nDuring the course of his campaign Donald Trump has made statements that mainstream politicians would consider disastrous gaffes, alienating important parts of the electorate.\n\"When Mexico sends its people,\" Trump told an audience in Arizona, \"they're not sending their best. They're sending people that have lots of problems. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists...\"\nIt was a remark bound to alienate Hispanic voters. But others liked Trump for saying what he thinks.\nOne recent poll shows him having 24% support for the Republican nomination - well ahead of second-placed Jeb Bush's 11%.\nOne of Trump's key messages is that he is so rich that no one can buy him.\nJeremy Corbyn, who has a record as one of the Labour Party's most rebellious MPs, argues that while many of his colleagues duck and weave, he is an honourable man committed to core principles on which he will not compromise.\nHis ability to pack halls with huge crowds suggest it's a message that has great resonance.\nIn Europe - especially in southern countries hit hard by the financial crisis - some insurgent politicians have broken through.\nHistorically most European populist parties - which generally pit the people against a self-serving elite - have been on the right.\nBut in recent years the left too has produced Spain's Podemas and in Greece, Syriza, which went from a protest party to forming the government, taking on the bureaucrats in Brussels.\nIn the last UK general election Nigel Farage's UKIP won support by arguing that it was prepared to confront issues that the Westminster politicians were trying to dodge.\nAnd in Scotland the SNP swept to power, partly by running against what the party portrayed as a privileged and remote political establishment in London.\nThere are a number of explanations for the increasing number of people who resent mainstream politicians.\nAs well as a long-term fall in the levels of deference, sceptics point to spin doctors, focus groups, heavily managed public appearances and mainstream politicians' use of vacuous, scripted language.\nCampaign finance scandals also create mistrust.\nIt is estimated that to run a successful re-election campaign a US senator needs to raise over $14,000 (\u00c2\u00a38,900) every day that he or she is in office.\nAware that they are distrusted, some politicians try to connect with voters by emoting in public.\nWhen Hilary Clinton was performing worse that expected in the 2008 New Hampshire Democratic Party primary contest, she broke down in tears on TV.\nAnalysts at the time said that moment helped her to secure victory in the state.\nBut even if many mainstream politicians cast an envious glance at colleagues perceived to be authentic, there are limits to conviction politics.\nOn both sides of the Atlantic the current phases of the electoral cycles means Trump and Corbyn are appealing for support from active party members.\nIf either win they will face the daunting challenge of broadening their appeal to less politically committed voters.\nAnd even then authenticity does not always produce the results voters are hoping for.\nJose Mujica of Uruguay is generally considered to have been one of the most authentic politicians of modern times.\nHaving won the presidency in 2010 he turned down the chance to live in the presidential palace, staying instead in his modest home on the outskirts of Montevideo.\nA revolutionary fighter who spent over a decade in prison, Mujica stayed true to many of his ideals, giving away 90% of his presidential salary.\nJose Mujica: The world's 'poorest' president\nBut even some of President Mujica's allies said that their leader's undimmed idealism did not turn into as many practical reforms as they had hoped for.\nAnd for all Mujica's impassioned and heartfelt denunciations of consumerism, most Uruguayans were just as materialistic at the end of his term in office as they were at the start.\nMany admire authentic politicians. But those who stay true to their beliefs and manage to win power still face the challenge of turning their ideas into implementable policy.\nSubscribe to the Newshour Extra podcast.",

    "PM Viktor Orban said Hungary would not allow migrants to leave its territory without registering.\nHis comments came as Hungarian authorities opened the main rail station in Budapest to hundreds of migrants after a two-day stand-off.\nOne train left, but then stopped near a migrant reception centre.\nMigrants mostly from Syria but also from Iraq, Pakistan and Afghanistan resisted efforts by police to get them off the train at Bicske, about 40km (25 miles) west of Budapest. Some were banging on the windows and shouting \"Germany, Germany.\"\nFollow our live updates\nEU rules place responsibility for assessing asylum claims on the country where a migrant first arrives.\nMany of the migrants currently in Hungary have been refusing to register there, in order to continue their journeys to Germany before seeking asylum.\nNothing illustrates how difficult this crisis is to resolve than what has happened to these several hundred refugees who are currently on this train at Bicske. They jumped on the train after waiting at Budapest station for three hours. They were really tightly crammed in - women and babies. They were told no international trains would leave. but eventually they were told this train would leave and they believed and hoped it would take them close enough to the Austrian border to get across.\nThere were some police on board. We got as far as Bickse and when the train pulled in, there were loads of police waiting for them on the platform. The plan seemed to be to remove them, to take them to a centre where they would be properly identified. Some people left the first carriage, but almost immediately there was resistance, a lot of people were banging on the windows, some were shouting \"Germany! Germany!\" The police put on riot gear.\nAnd then there was one really distressing scene involving a woman who was carrying a baby by the railway tracks shouting \"help! help!\" There was a struggle involving one of her companions and riot police. This incensed some of the other refugees who had been taken off the train, they began pushing and jostling and there was a little bit of fighting with the riot police. And then they forced their way back on the train, which is where we are at the moment with police on the platform with several hundred refugees on the train in sweltering conditions.\nInternational services from Budapest's Keleti station were suspended indefinitely. There have been days of tension at the station.\nThe number of migrants entering Europe has reached record levels this year. Germany expects to take in 800,000 asylum seekers this year - four times last year's total.\nThe surge in numbers has created tension and disagreement over EU migration policy. Germany has been prepared to accept large numbers of asylum seekers, but other countries have not.\nMr Orban, who heads the anti-immigration Fidesz party and was in Brussels for talks, said Hungarians and other Europeans were \"full of fear\" because \"they see that the European leaders, among them the prime ministers, are not able to control the situation\".\nDuring a tense press conference with European Parliament President Martin Schulz, the Hungarian leader said that \"nobody would like to stay in Hungary, neither in Slovakia nor Poland nor Estonia.\n\"All of them would like to go to Germany,\" he said. \"Our job is only to register them.\"\nMr Schulz countered: \"What we are seeing for the time being is egoism instead of common European sense.\n\"To say 'yeah, you know we have refugees all over in Europe but they all want to go to Germany and therefore we are not concerned' is effective, but wrong. And therefore I think we need a fair and just distribution.\"\nEuropean Council president Donald Tusk said on Thursday that EU countries should accept at least 100,000 asylum seekers between them, a sharp increase on a previous European Commission target of 40,000.\nEU states instead so far committed to sharing some 32,000 asylum seekers from Italy and Greece.\nMr Tusk also took Mr Orban to task for comments in which the Hungarian leader said his country was being \"overrun\" with refugees who threatened to undermine Europe's Christian roots.\nHe said: \"Referring to Christianity in a public debate on migration must mean in the first place the readiness to show solidarity and sacrifice.\"\nThe human cost of the crisis was also put into sharp focus on Wednesday when five children were among 12 migrants who drowned in Turkish waters while trying to reach Greece.\nImages of the washed-up body of a three-year-old boy, who died alongside his mother and five-year-old brother, circulated widely on social media.\nCzech unease at migrant numbering\nFive obstacles to an EU migrants deal\nThose who risk everything for a better life\nThe word migrant is defined in the Oxford English Dictionary as \"one who moves, either temporarily or permanently, from one place, area, or country of residence to another\".\nA refugee is, according to the 1951 Refugee Convention, any person who \"owing to a well-founded fear\" of persecution is outside their country of nationality and \"unable\" or \"unwilling\" to seek the protection of that country.

Those qualities must have been there in the man.\"\nThe portrait was painted by renowned American artist Tim O'Brien, and will be projected onto buildings around the orchestra's home towns of Newcastle and Gateshead over the coming months.\nRegarded as one of the greatest composers of all time, Mozart wrote more than 600 works, including some of the most celebrated and enduring pieces of classical music, before he died at the age of 35.\nOnly 14 images of the composer are known to have been created during his lifetime, but many are stylised or incomplete.\nThe best physical description came from baritone Luigi Bassi, for whom Mozart had written the role of Don Giovanni.\n\"Mr Mozart was an extremely eccentric and absent-minded young man, but not without a certain spirit of pride,\" he said. \"He was very popular with the ladies, in spite of his small size; but he had a most unusual face, and he could cast a spell on any woman with his eyes.\"\nDescribing the existing portraits as \"cosy and pretty\", O'Brien explained the thinking behind his new painting.\n\"I know of few musicians of real depth where you can't see some of that complexity in the face.  So to find the Mozart who was obsessively driven, who pushed boundaries and who lived in a world where harsh poverty and crime were a very real facts, I looked at musicians from our own era to provide some inspiration.\n\"Photos of Johnny Cash and Eric Clapton suggested both obsession and some kind of danger. Johnny Rotten provided a certain precocious brilliance, and I related to those for Mozart.\"\nO'Brien previously made headlines by creating a portrait of Beethoven for the cover of Gramophone magazine, which was inspired by U2 singer Bono.\nThe portrait accompanies the Northern Sinfonia's new season, which includes a series of concerts called Reclaiming Mozart.\nThey begin on Friday, 18 September with the first movement of Mozart's Symphony No. 25, and will also include his Clarinet Concerto and the rarely performed Symphony No. 33.\nMusical director Vogt will be the soloist in the Quintet for Piano and Wind, of which Mozart once wrote: \"I myself consider it to be the best thing I have written in my life.\"\nThe German concert pianist and conductor, who recently played the first night of the Proms, is an avowed Mozart fan - whose desert island disc would be a box set of the composer's works.\nIn his first season as director of the Sinfonia, he plans to stage a number of \"pop-up\" concerts in venues that echo the \"darker corners of Vienna\" that Mozart would have frequented in the 18th Century.",

He said the Russian parliament itself had in 2010 directly blamed Soviet dictator Josef Stalin for ordering the 1940 massacre of 20,000 Polish prisoners of war at Katyn.\nMr Andreyev had argued that Poland was partly responsible for what happened in September 1939, because \"during the 1930s Poland repeatedly blocked the formation of a coalition against Hitler's Germany\".\nThe war erupted in September 1939 when Nazi Germany invaded Poland from the west, little over a week after the USSR and Germany signed the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact. Soviet forces entered Poland from the east that same month, as part of the secret agreement.\nMr Andreyev had also suggested that the Soviet invasion was \"to ensure the safety of the USSR\" and was not an aggressive act.\nPolish Prime Minister Ewa Kopacz pointed out at the weekend that \"even children in Poland know that neither Ribbentrop nor Molotov was Polish\", condemning the Nazi-Soviet carve-up of her country.\nThe ambassador's interview on Friday was broadcast hours after Poland's ambassador to Moscow, Katarzyna Pelczynska-Nalecz, was herself summoned to the Russian foreign ministry because the graves of 57 Soviet soldiers were vandalised at a cemetery in Milejczyce in north-eastern Poland.

    "IS and other jihadist groups appear to be exploiting new functionality introduced by the app last month, which allows users to broadcast their messages to an unlimited number of members via their own Telegram \"channel\".\nOn 26 September, just four days after Telegram trumpeted the launch of its new \"Channels\" tool, IS media operatives on Twitter started advertising the group's own channel dubbed Nashir, which translates as \"Distributor\" in English.\nIt has already amassed more than 4,500 subscribers.\nSince then, IS propaganda has started appearing first via Telegram, often several minutes before being posted to Twitter.\nThe group's claim for an attack on Saudi and Emirati forces at a hotel in the Yemeni city of Aden on Tuesday was posted first on Telegram, for example, although Twitter remains a key platform for IS to spread its message.\nIS appears to be hoping the Berlin-based Telegram will offer it a more stable and resilient platform for its propaganda, faced with a sustained clampdown on its Twitter presence.\nBut Telegram itself suggests it will take down illegal material that is made publicly available via the app - including posts related to IS, according to its website.\nIS has not had an official presence on Twitter since July 2014, when its last branded accounts were shut down.\nIt then experimented with a series of less well-known social media platforms, such as the privacy-focused Diaspora as well as VKontakte, Russia's largest social network, whose co-founders the Durov brothers went on to set up Telegram in 2013.\nBut IS was soon kicked off those platforms too.\nSince then, Twitter has remained the group's preferred platform. But it has been caught up in a cat-and-mouse game with the Twitter administration, which has also led to its quasi-official, non-branded accounts routinely suspended.\nEven before IS launched its latest propaganda channel via Telegram, there had been evidence that the group and its members were using the app.\nEarlier in September, IS had advertised an Iraqi mobile phone number, which people could use to get in touch with the group via the Telegram app in order to pay a ransom for two hostages being held by the group.\nAnd jihadists inspired by IS, including a British teenager convicted recently, have used the app's secure encrypted messaging to conduct attack planning.\nJihadists have been drawn by Telegram's boast to provide a \"secret chat\" facility, which heavily encrypts messages user-to-user with a unique key to avoid interception by hackers or government agencies.\nTelegram is so confident of its security that it twice offered a $300,000 reward to the first person who could crack its encryption.\nBut it is the app's new public broadcast function that jihadists have been quick to latch on to and it is not just IS that has started exploiting it.\nAl-Qaeda's Yemen branch (AQAP) launched its own Telegram \"channel\" on 25 September, although its material is still coming out first via Twitter, where the group has its own official accounts.

    "The All Blacks were almost out of sight at half-time, Julian Savea scoring two tries and Brodie Retallick and Nehe Milner-Skudder one apiece.\nA try by Louis Picamoles had kept France afloat but when he was sent to the sin-bin French hopes evaporated.\nSavea completed a fine hat-trick and Jerome Kaino, Kieran Read and Tawera Kerr-Barlow (two) also crossed.\nFrance had hoped to draw inspiration from their World Cup upsets over the All Blacks in 1999 and 2007, when they beat them in the quarter-finals in Cardiff, as well as their near-miss in the 2011 final, when they narrowly lost 8-7.\nBut New Zealand, who have now beaten France nine times in a row and equalled Australia's record of 12 consecutive World Cup wins, never looked like losing against a Philippe Saint-Andre side forced to deny they are in outright rebellion.\nAnd while the French simply did not have the requisite talent or a game-plan to trouble New Zealand, the performance of Steve Hansen's side was undoubtedly the most impressive of the tournament so far.\nNew Zealand started in breathless fashion and Dan Carter translated their pressure into three points after Thierry Dusautoir was penalised for not releasing.\nFrance were level almost immediately, full-back Scott Spedding slotting a penalty from inside his own half, before second-row Retallick charged down a Freddie Michalak clearance kick and romped over for New Zealand's first try.\nThe All Blacks were nullified for a while by some stout French defence, until Ma'a Nonu and Conrad Smith, playing their 60th Test together in the centres, fed the ball to the brilliant Milner-Skudder, who conjured a try from nothing, stepping off his right foot and leaving the French defence for dead.\nAnd when Savea went over for New Zealand's 300th World Cup try, after a wonderful back-of-the-hand offload from Carter, France looked doomed.\nPicamoles, France's inspirational number eight, had other ideas and latched onto a loose pass in front of New Zealand's posts and barged over, but when he was sin-binned for putting his fist in a prone Richie McCaw's face soon after the restart, the French challenge evaporated.\nSavea had already grabbed his second just before half-time, the 6ft 4in, 17-stone wing displaying great strength to smash through three tackles and score his seventh try of the tournament.\nAnd after Picamoles' departure Kaino trotted over unopposed before Savea finished from 40 metres out to equal Jonah Lomu and Bryan Habana's record of eight tries in an individual tournament and make it 38 tries in 39 Tests.\nSome cute interplay between Charlie Faumuina and number eight Read ended with the latter touching down next to the posts, before replacement scrum-half Kerr-Barlow came off the bench to grab a clinical double as the world champions ran riot.\nNew Zealand rarely clicked despite topping Pool C, but four competitive matches appear to have been exactly what they needed in terms of sharpening them up for the knockout stages.\nSouth Africa, who were shocked by Japan in their opening World Cup game, have mounted a stirring recovery and are battle-hardened after a bruising quarter-final victory over Wales.\nBut the All Blacks appear to have too much variety for the one-dimensional Springboks, who have beaten New Zealand only twice in their last 12 meetings.\nSuch a chastening defeat might be the best thing that could have happened to French rugby after the insipid reign of Saint-Andre.\nWhen Toulouse coach Guy Noves takes over, the first thing he will have to address is his country's rugby philosophy, which is now less about flair and more about brute force, which on its own is rarely enough at the highest level.\nHowever, Noves's biggest challenge will be attempting to persuade French clubs playing in the Top 14, who are often successful in European competition, to play in a more expansive manner. The post-mortem will be long and cruel.\nNew Zealand head coach Steve Hansen: \"It was a very pleasing performance and everyone from number one to 23 played their part.\n\"We can't wait [to play South Africa]. We're playing against great opposition. They are a great team and we enjoy their company and we will enjoy playing them.\"\nNew Zealand captain Richie McCaw: \"The intensity was always going to go up a notch and we talked about it all week about needing to be up a notch.\n\"I am just proud of the guys, especially at the start of the game, we got on to it and applied pressure right around the field.\"\nFrance head coach Philippe Saint-Andre: \"Of course they [fans] are disappointed.

    "Spending reviews - where the chancellor sets out how much each government department can spend for the next three or four years - were introduced by Gordon Brown in 1998.\nGeorge Osborne held his first Spending Review in 2010. His second, which covered a single year, 2015/16, came in 2013.\nWednesday's Spending Review will set departmental budgets for the next four years - up to the 2020 general election.\nMr Osborne says he has now reached a settlement with all government departments. He has played down reports of rows with Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith and Home Secretary Theresa May, both of whom face big cuts in their budgets.\nHealth, schools, international aid and defence will escape cuts but Mr Osborne has asked unprotected departments to find a total of \u00a320bn in savings as part of plans to balance the government's books.\n(The past spending cut figures are taken from the IFS analysis of the latest Treasury figures for changes to departmental expenditure limits between 2010/11 and 2015/16, taking into account the impact of inflation.)\nCuts since 2010: 24.9%\nWhere the axe fell 2010-2015: The police budget has been cut by 4% a year. About 17,000 frontline police jobs have been lost over the past five years, according to the Police Federation.\nWhat's next: In line for further sizeable cuts, with police chiefs warning that a cut of 25%, at the bottom end of the expected range, could threaten the future of some forces. At least 22,000 jobs will be lost, according to unofficial estimates seen by The Guardian. Home Secretary Theresa May has suggested some forces could share resources. She has also been warned by one of the UK's most senior police officers that cuts on the scale expected could \"reduce very significantly\" the country's ability to respond to a Paris-style terrorist attack. George Osborne has said he is confident the UK would have the resources to respond to such a threat but made clear the police, like all public services, will have to make savings.\nCuts since 2010: 13.5%\nWhere the axe fell 2010-2015: Reductions in the size of the army and Royal Navy, delays to fighter jet upgrades, scrapping the Nimrod spy plane and halving the number of jets to be deployed on two new aircraft carriers.\nWhat's next: The chancellor pledged in his summer Budget to meet Nato's target of spending 2% of national income on defence every year, up to 2020. That means spending on defence will rise in real terms - 0.5% above inflation - every year during the Parliament. David Cameron has said this will mean a larger Navy, a larger RAF and a better-equipped Army, with an extra \u00a312bn over the next decade for new equipment and logistical support. The \u00a331bn predicted cost of four new Trident nuclear submarines, which is \u00a36bn higher than was estimated in 2010, is not included in these figures. Chancellor George Osborne is reportedly bidding to take control of that contract, for which there is also a \u00a310bn contingency fund, from the Ministry of Defence. The MoD will also be forced to sell off 30% of the land it owns and shed 30% of its civilian staff as part of \u00a311bn in efficiency savings.\nCuts since 2010: 18.4%\nWhere the axe fell 2010-2015: BiS was ordered to find 25% savings in George Osborne's first spending review in 2010, although in practice the cuts did not turn out to be as severe as that. The university teaching budget took a big hit and dozens of quangos were abolished.\nWhat's next: A likely target for further significant cuts. Business Secretary Sajid Javid has drawn up plans to close down some of its 80 offices and cut its remaining quangos by half to as few as 20, closing seven separate research councils, according to the Financial Times. Some 200 civil servants are taking voluntary redundancy, the paper says.\nCuts since 2010: 34.1%\nWhere the axe fell 2010-2015: Spending was slashed by 23% in 2010 and then by a further 10% in 2013, making an overall cut of \u00a32.1bn. This was largely achieved by cutting the number and cost of prison places. There are also plans to cut legal aid and close 91 courts and tribunals in England and Wales, and integrate or merge another 31.\nWhat's next: Justice Secretary Michael Gove has announced plans for nine new prisons, to be funded by selling off old prisons for housing. He will be expected to find significant further savings, which he has said he would like to achieve, in part, by reducing re-offending rates meaning fewer people returning to prison. The Chief Inspector of Prisons has warned about the dangers of overcrowding if the budget is cut further.\nCuts since 2010: 21.6%\nWhere the axe fell 2010-2015: More than half of the savings came from transferring the cost of the World Service to the BBC. There was also a reduction in the number of Whitehall based diplomats and a cut in capital spending.\nWhat's next: The Foreign Office has submitted proposals for budget cuts of between 25% and 40%, according to the Financial Times. Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond is said to be concerned about possible embassy closures. There have also been warnings about redundancies at Foreign Office HQ. However, the department is to boost funding to the World Service by \u00a334m in 2016-17, spending \u00a385m in each of the following three years.\nCuts since 2010: 30.7%\nWhere the axe fell 2010-2015: There were big cuts in administration costs and a 30% cut in the budget of Arts Council (England).\nWhat's next: Likely to be further cuts to arts funding with the National Lottery expected to make up shortfalls. Free museum entry likely to remain protected.\nIncrease since 2010: 7.3%\nWhere 2010-2015 increases went: Health is a protected department. The government pledged to increase funding for the NHS in England, in real terms, (which means the amount spent on it went up by more than the rate of inflation) every year between 2011 and 2015. The Department of Health says it met that pledge through a 5% real terms increase. At the same time the NHS has had to find billions in efficiency savings and the Department of Health was expected to save \u00a3200m itself in 2015-6.\nWhat's next: George Osborne has set about fulfilling the Conservative manifesto pledge of increasing the funding for NHS England by \u00a38bn in real terms as demanded by the boss of NHS England Simon Stevens. By 2020-21 the total budget will be \u00a3119.6bn, a rise of \u00a38.4bn once inflation is taken into account. The increases are front-loaded, with frontline NHS services getting a \u00a33.8bn, above-inflation cash injection next year. But details of what is happening to other areas of health spending, such as staff training budgets and the money held by councils to pay for public health schemes from stop smoking clinics to sexual health service, has not being released yet. Doubts also remain about what protection social care will get. The chancellor is understood to be considering allowing local authorities to increase council tax by 2% to pay for care.\nCuts since 2010: 6.4%\nWhere the axe fell 2010-2015: Schools budgets are protected but the rest of the department's spending is not - capital spending, on new buildings and equipment, has been cut, as has post-16 education and early years. Spending on the four-to-16-year-olds schools budget went up by 3% while cash spending per pupil rose by 6%.\nWhat's next: The government has again vowed to protect cash spending per pupil although no details have been revealed. But experts say upward pressure on school budgets from growing pupil numbers and pay demands will mean a growing strain on resources. There had been questions about the free school meals for all infants policy, but David Cameron has ruled out that being axed.\nIncrease since 2010: 24.1%\nWhere 2010-2015 increases went:  Justine Greening's international development department is protected from cuts and has seen its budget increase year-on-year, with most of the extra cash going to aid agencies rather than projects run by the UK government.\nWhat's next: The government will continue spending 0.7% of GDP on overseas aid in line with the UN target. although critics will be keeping an eye out for expenditure in other departments being re-categorised as international aid. In a change of policy, half of all Dfid's budget will be spent in \"fragile\" countries and regions, including the Middle East and South Asia, each year between 2016 and 2020. There will also be an extra \u00a3300m a year for the Conflict, Stability and Security Fund by 2020 while funding for developing countries to deal with climate change will double over four years.\nSeparate welfare and pensions budget: \u00a3216bn\nCuts since 2010: 35.8%\nWhere the axe fell 2010-2015:  More than \u00a321bn has been cut from the welfare budget. Controversial cuts to housing benefit, dubbed the \"bedroom tax\" by critics, and a \u00a326,000 cap on the total amount households can claim affected relatively small numbers of people. The biggest savings were achieved through cash freezes to child benefit and changes to how working age benefits are increased each year, as well as a 1% limit on most benefit rises.\nWhat's next: The Treasury is seeking a further \u00a312bn in cuts to welfare spending by 2018/19. It has now reached a deal with the Treasury, although the details have yet to be announced. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith appears to have seen off an attempt by the Treasury to make his department swallow the \u00a34bn cost of measures to ease the impact of cuts to tax credits. This would have been achieved by cutting work incentives offered through the new Universal Credit. Mr Duncan Smith is reported to have threatened to resign over the issue but sources say the dispute is now over.\nBudget increase since 2010: 14.3%\nWhere 2010-2015 increases went: DECC is not a protected department so you would expect its budget to have been slashed. But 2013 measures to ease energy bill increases by adjusting green levies meant it went up overall during the last Parliament. There were also big investments in carbon capture and storage technology.\nWhat's next: DECC will not get such an easy ride this time. It has reached an agreement with the Treasury, expected to be around 21%, although the full details have yet to be announced. The biggest chunk of its budget goes on nuclear decommissioning - and that can't be touched. So it can expect cuts of 46% in its other activities in 2017/18 before spending increases again, according analysis by the Green Alliance. Remaining budgets for green subsidies are likely to be in the firing line. It has already begun a job cuts programme, according to the Financial Times.\nBudget increase since 2010: 4.9%\nWhere 2010-2015 increases went: The Cabinet Office was hit with a 33% core budget cut in the 2010 spending review, which it achieved through efficiency savings and a freeze on Royal Household spending. But the vast majority of its budget is taken up by the Security and Intelligence agencies, which have seen their budgets increase significantly in recent years.\nWhat's next: The Cabinet Office is something of a special case as it covers so many different functions across the whole of government, including driving through efficiency savings. It has now reached a spending deal with the Treasury. The details have yet to be revealed but Chancellor George Osborne has promised an extra \u00a31.9bn a year for cyber security as part of a 30% increase in the counter-terrorism budget.\nCuts since 2010: 29.9%\nWhere the axe fell 2010-2015: Defra was one of the biggest casualties of the 2010 spending review. The 2013 floods did change the picture slightly, with billions in extra capital investment in flood defences promised. But the department was still asked for find an extra \u00a383m in savings in 2015-6.\nWhat's next: Defra was one of the first departments to \"settle\" its funding with the Treasury. It is one of four departments to have agreed to budget cuts over the next four years that average out at 30%. How much of a hit Defra will take has yet to be revealed. But its capital funding has yet to be announced, with the Treasury pledging to back flood protection.\nCuts since 2010: 13.4%\nWhere the axe fell 2010-2015: Had to make cuts to running costs but big capital projects such as Crossrail and HS2 got the go-ahead. It was asked to find an extra \u00a3545m in savings in 2015-6, the largest of any single department - the bulk coming from selling off land adjacent to King's Cross station.\nWhat's next: Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin, pictured above, settled early with the Treasury. His department is one of four to have agreed to budget cuts over the next four years that average out at 30%. How much of a hit each department will take has yet to be revealed. But, again, capital spending is not included and the government says it wants to spend \u00a3100bn on infrastructure upgrades over the period.\nCuts since 2010: 51%\nWhere the axe fell 2010-2015: DCLG took the biggest hit of any department, in percentage terms, in the last Parliament. The communities-focused part of its budget was cut in half and direct grants to local government fell by 27% in real terms between 2011 and 2015. A further \u00a3230m in savings was sought in 2015-6 although the department said this did not affect any existing programs.\nWhat's next: Communities Secretary Greg Clark, pictured above, was one of the first cabinet ministers to settle with the Treasury. His department is one of four to have agreed to budget cuts over the next four years that average out at 30%. How much of a hit each department will take has yet to be revealed. And this figure does not include the revenue grant for town halls, which is determined on an annual basis.\nCuts since 2010: 29.9%\nWhere the axe fell 2010-2015: Capital spending was cut by 30% and savings made in other areas.\nWhat's next: Not surprisingly, given it is his department, George Osborne has already reached a deal with the Treasury. It is one of four to have agreed to budget cuts over the next four years that average out at 30%. How much of a hit each department will take has yet to be revealed.\nThe Treasury also oversees HM Revenue and Customs, which means it will have to find a way of saving up to \u00a34bn to reduce the impact of tax credit cuts after the House of Lords rejected them. HMRC has reached an agreement with the Treasury on a cuts programme, which will see savings made through the \"digitisation\" of the tax system and the closure of \"low value\" programmes.\nCuts since 2010: 8.5%\nThe majority of public spending in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland is calculated using the Barnett formula - a system of grants allocated according to the population size of each nation and which powers are devolved to them. When the UK government increases or decreases funding for departments such as health and education in England, the Barnett formula is used to decide how much devolved governments will receive.\nWhere the axe fell 2010-2015: The Scottish Barnett block grant fell \u00a31bn in cash terms between 2009/10 and 2011/12, from \u00a329.7bn to \u00a328.7bn. The grant is currently just below 2011/12 levels, in cash terms.\nWhat's next: The Scottish Office, Northern Ireland Office and Welsh Office have all reached a deal with the Treasury. The details have yet to be revealed but they are part of a package of cuts to seven departments that average 21% in total by 2020.\nThe Scottish government has promised to protect health spending which could force ministers to make deeper cuts in other areas. But it will have more scope to raise additional revenue through the partial devolution of income tax and VAT, and the whole of Air Passenger Duty.\nThe next block grant will be cut to compensate the UK government for tax revenues lost through the devolution of Stamp Duty land tax and landfill tax.\nCuts since 2010: 8.7%\nWhere the axe fell 2010-2015:  Welsh government finance minister Jane Hutt says \u00a31.3bn has been \"taken out of vital public services\" over the past five years.\nWhat's next: Planned cash increases to NHS spending will be reflected in a funding boost for the NHS in Wales and this could offset other cuts. Non-devolved departmental spending in Wales will fall by approximately \u00a3260m by 2018-19: this is a reduction of 16% in real terms, according to an analysis by The Institute for Welsh Affairs.\nCuts since 2010: 8:8%\nWhere the axe fell: Stormont's spending power was cut by more than \u00a31bn, in real terms, between 2010 and 2015, although health and schools spending was protected.\nWhat's next: The Northern Ireland executive expects a continued real-term decline in funding levels, mirroring the UK-wide squeeze. The Northern Ireland Office has reached a spending agreement with the Treasury.\nPresented by Chancellor George Osborne, the Spending Review sets out what government spending will be over the next four years, while the Autumn Statement is an annual update of government plans for the economy.\nExplained: Which government departments will be affected?\nAnalysis: From BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg\nSpecial report: Full in-depth coverage of the Spending Review and Autumn Statement\nWatch: The BBC's TV coverage begins on BBC Two and the BBC News Channel at 11:30 GMT, with BBC Radio 5 Live coverage from 11:55 GMT",

    "Martin Shkreli's drug company Turing Pharmaceuticals bought the rights to 62-year old drug Daraprim and increased the price per pill from $13.50 to $750.\nTuring said it will cut the price by 50% for hospitals and offer financial assistance to individuals.\nHowever, the company will keep its list price at the new higher level.\nIn September Turing promised to reduce the price.\nThe pill costs around $1 for patients in Europe.\nIn statement Turing's chief commercial officer Nancy Retzlaff defended the company's move. She said that reducing the listing price would not have translated into saving for patients.\n\"Drug pricing is one of the most complex parts of the healthcare industry. A drug's list price is not the primary factor in determining patient affordability and access,\" Ms Retzlaff said.\nDoctors though worry keeping the price so high will make it impossible for hospitals to stock the drug for the few patients who need it.\n\"The decision not to lower the price leaves patients in the same boat,\" said Dr Joel Gallant, medical director of special service at Southwest Care centre.\nThough Turing is offering payment assistance for some patients, Dr Gallant said this could still leave patients waiting for treatment.\n\"Patients start the drug in the hospital, but then they need to be discharged with the drug. While they wait for patient assistance to be approved they could be re-hospitalised,\" said Dr Gallant.\nThe original increase sparked outrage on social media and among politicians.\nDemocratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton called the increase \"price gouging\".\nTuring's chief executive Martin Shkreli- who had been labelled the most hated man in America-fought back saying politicians did not understand Pharmaceutical pricing.\nHe later backed down and promised to lower the price of the drug, though never said by how much.\nMr Shkreli told ABC news in September, \"'We've agreed to lower the price of Daraprim to a point that is more affordable and is able to allow the company to make a profit, but a very small profit.\"",
    "Well, it is because the government's forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, has increased its prognosis of how much the Treasury will raise from existing taxes (not new ones) and reduced what it thinks the chancellor will shell out in interest on its massive debts.\nIn total the OBR thinks the national debt, the aggregate of the annual deficits, will be \u00a323bn lower over the four years to 2020, and just because it is more optimistic about tax revenues and assorted costs.\nOr to put it another way, George Osborne is today \u00a323bn better off than he thought in July, and without doing anything at all.\nWindfall\nSo what is the chancellor doing with this very useful \u00a323bn that the OBR has found at the back of the sofa?\nWell he is using \u00a319bn of it to cover the \u00a34.4bn annual cost of not slashing tax credits, and making about \u00a38bn a year less than expected in departmental savings.\nSo on paper it looks as though the chancellor is actually being a bit more prudent than he was in July, even though some would say he is expensively moving his party nearer to the centre-ground of British politics - which he thinks has been vacated by Jeremy Corbyn's Labour.\nTo labour the point, George Osborne is not deploying quite all of his windfall to buy off his critics by taking the teeth out of austerity.\nBut that does not mean there is no risk for him.\nThe OBR's fiscal optimism could well be misplaced - especially since only last week we saw government borrowing figures hideously worse than expected.\nBut presumably, if tax revenues turn out lower and interest payments higher than the chancellor is now banking on, he can attempt to blame and kick the forecasting agency, the OBR, which he created.\nAnd he'll hope, presumably, that voters won't see double standards in his years of bashing his Labour predecessors for spending tax revenues that never looked sustainable.\nGeorge Osborne has not quite morphed into his former opposite number, Ed Balls. But he is, in a more Ballsian way, counting on economic recovery to mend his overstretched finances.\nUPDATE 20:21\nI have had a quick word with Robert Chote of the OBR, and he says that even if he had seen October's lamentable borrowing figures he would not have changed his deficit projections.\nHis expectation is that revenues will rise for the government because of measures already taken, but which have not yet led to a higher tax yield.",

But transformation will not happen overnight.\n\"Every CCG has worked with local partners including children and young people to deliver plans to improve access to effective services.\"\nThe Department of Health said that an additional \u00a3250m would be invested in children's mental health services in the next financial year.\nNHS England says \u00a389m will be allocated to CCGs, but the money has not been ring-fenced.",
    "Jay Bell's actions on 26 July 2013 caused the infant to suffer brain bleeding, retinal haemorrhages and a broken rib and ankle.\nAs a result of the brain injury, the child suffers from cerebral palsy and is registered blind.\nBell, 23, from Mayfield in Dalkeith, last month admitted to two charges.\nHe pleaded guilty to culpable and reckless conduct towards the child to his severe injury, permanent impairment and to the danger of his life and a second charge of wilfully neglecting the baby and failing to seek medical attention for him.\nPassing sentence at the High Court in Edinburgh on Thursday, judge Paul Arthurson QC described the offences as \"extremely serious\".\nThe baby did not receive hospital treatment for about two weeks and Bell took about five months to reveal what had happened to the child when he was in his care.\nThe court heard Bell threw the child in the air repeatedly but the baby hit his head on the wall, then hit a Moses basket and fell on the floor.\nBell then picked him up and shook him repeatedly until he began to cry.\nThe court heard the child was eventually admitted to the Royal Hospital for Sick Children on 10 August 2013 and it took Bell until December that year to disclose fully what had happened to the baby.\nHad the child gone to hospital straight after suffering the brain injury, medical intervention may have limited the impact of that injury, the judge said.\nProsecutors accepted that while Bell's conduct was culpable and reckless, it lacked the \"wicked intent\" of an assault.\nDefence counsel John Keenan said Bell never set out to harm the child.\nHe has shown remorse and is having \"extreme difficulty\" coming to terms with what happened, the solicitor advocate said.\nThe judge said Bell's culpability was at the lower end of the scale.\n\"I accept that while the consequences for the child were truly catastrophic, these were not intended by you,\" he told Bell.\n\"Nevertheless, taking into account your position of care and trust and the extreme vulnerability of the child, the only appropriate disposal for the offences is a substantial custodial one.\"",

He made me feel very uncomfortable\"\nShe later explained how visits to Howard's flat were mostly fine, and uneventful.\nBut one visit became a \"nightmare\" when Howard came into a room and assaulted her.\nShe told the court: \"I thought we were playing an innocent game of hide and go seek.\"\nBut she said the assault began instead.\n\"I knew that Bob Howard was gong to have sex with me against my will and I was so lucky to get away,\" she said.\nShe said she shouted for Donna Quinn, the teenage daughter of Howard's girlfriend, who she said was also in the flat at the time.\nShe said when she was struggling to get away from Howard: \"I was thinking that he was going to rape me, and I knew I had to do something.\"\nEventually, the court heard, she was able to strike Howard with her knee and get away.\nWhen she ran to find her friend Donna Quinn in another room she said she was surprised to see her sitting in a chair there.\nShe also explained how she immediately left the flat and never had anything to do with either Robert Howard or Donna Quinn again.\nThe woman explained how for years she had not told anyone what had happened, until she spoke to detectives about it in 2002.\nShe told a barrister: \"That was a living nightmare. When it came into my head, I had to shut it out.\"\nHoward was later convicted of the assault of a different teenager and the murder of teenager Hannah Williams in London.\nArlene, who was from Castlederg, vanished after a night at a disco in County Donegal in 1994.\nLater, a social worker told the inquest that Arlene had been \"dealt a pretty raw hand by life\".\nShe was referring to the teenager's difficulties after the death of her mother in 1990.\nMichelle McKernan told police that Arlene was missing in August 1994. She did so with the agreement of Arlene's family.\nThis happened a few days after Arlene was last seen - her brothers and sisters had thought she was staying with another family member.\nMs McKernan described Arlene as a softly-spoken young person, with beautiful long hair, and who was always wearing makeup when she met her.\nShe was questioned at length by a barrister for the PSNI about the date she reported Arlene missing to the police - her case records of making the call and the police records of receiving it differ by two days.",

    "Six authorities have told BBC Wales a meltdown in waste markets has hit their budgets.\nPembrokeshire council has seen the price it gets for steel drop by 88% over the year - while Flintshire has seen the price for plastics halved.\nExperts say a slump in oil prices, cheap steel imports, and China's economic slowdown are to blame.\n\"We try to play the markets as best we can,\" Harvey Mitchell, the waste services manager for Flintshire, said.\n\"It makes it difficult when we do have a drop in issues we can't control, such as the global price of oil, or when larger countries flood the European market with steel.\"\nFlintshire has been celebrating a record year for recycling household waste - up to 58% of everything thrown away now ends up at its waste recover facility in Buckley.\n\"But while we've seen an increase in the amount of material we've collected, we've actually seen a drop in the income because of the market prices,\" Mr Mitchell said.\nRecycled waste netted the council \u00a3537,000 in revenue in 2015/16, but this represented a drop of 45% in the expected income - more than \u00a3400,000 in lost cash.\nThe pattern has been repeated in Pembrokeshire, where \u00a3360,000 has been wiped off the council's expected income, while four other councils saw a combined drop of \u00a3335,000.\n\"This is an issue which is impacting upon Wales as a whole, not just Pembrokeshire,\" a council official there said.\n\"Fortunately quotes for the coming months are starting to look more positive with prices starting to increase.\"\nThe impact on most of the other Welsh councils which responded to BBC Wales has been minimal, as they said are tied into long term contracts dealing with their recycling services.\nBut one academic expert said authorities and the public in Wales will need to refocus as they face ever increasing targets on recycling.\nBy 2025 Welsh authorities are being asked to recycle 70% of waste - by 2050, it should be 100%.\n\"Waste prevention is what this is all about,\" Rebecca Colley-Jones, from Bangor University's Sustainability Lab, said.\n\"It's about buying smartly, being able to think about what you do with it so it can be reused, because reuse is a form of waste prevention.\n\"Together we can provide solutions for the future.\"",

    "The Royal Zoological Society of Scotland (RZSS) has placed male bear Arktos in with female Victoria at its Highland Wildlife Park near Aviemore.\nPolar bear cubs were last born in the UK almost 25 years ago.\nArktos is one of two male bears at the park at Kincraig in the Cairngorms National Park. The pair could remain together for about two weeks.\nArktos will eventually return to an enclosure he shares with the other male, Walker.\nRZSS said captive breeding was an important part of a wider effort to conserve polar bears, which are classified as \"vulnerable\" on the International Union Conservation of Nature's Red List of Threatened Species.\nHowever, animal welfare organisations OneKind Scotland and Born Free Foundation have said tackling climate change to better protect wild bears should be the focus of conservation efforts rather than captive breeding.\nRZSS, which also manages Edinburgh Zoo where efforts have been made to breed giant pandas, said Arktos and Victoria have mated several times so far.\nThe society said the pair would live together for the next week or two \"mimicking what would occur naturally in the wild\".\nVickie Larkin, head carnivore keeper at the park, said the pair had appeared to have bonded well since being introduced.\nShe said: \"Both polar bears have really warmed to each other and all the signs are really positive.\n\"From the first moment they met, Arktos has been really gentle with Victoria and their bond has been immediate.\n\"Polar bear breeding is inherently complex as the species are induced ovulators, meaning that the female only releases an egg after initial mating occurs. They also practice delayed implantation, where the egg doesn't implant into the uterine wall until some months later.\"\nMs Larkin added: \"If successful, Victoria will not fall pregnant until August to September time.\n\"Other key stages are her entering the birthing den in October to November and potentially giving birth in December to January. Any cubs would then not come out of the birthing den until March to April 2017.\"\nArktos arrived at the park in April 2012 from a zoo in Hannover, Germany.\nWhen being given health checks, park staff talk to Arktos in German, the language he heard when he was in the zoo in Hannover.\nVictoria, who was brought to Scotland from Aalborg Zoo in Denmark last year and is kept in an enclosure about a mile away from the males, previously raised cubs in 2008.",

    "So how did the individual players on each side fare?\nFormer Rangers and Scotland midfielder Stuart McCall assesses the performances of the Ibrox side, while former Celtic and Republic of Ireland goalkeeper Pat Bonner rates Ronny Deila's players.\nWes Foderingham (goalkeeper) 7\nDid OK and kept passing the ball short out of defence, which was the basis of Rangers' approach. Made a really important save from Tom Rogic soon after Celtic had clawed it back to 2-2. That was a huge moment and then he saved from Scott Brown in the shootout.\nJames Tavernier (defender) 7\nEverybody questioned him defensively beforehand, but he answered them all. Only once did he revert to fouling Patrick Roberts and he didn't give Gary Mackay-Steven a sniff when faced with him. Also kept attacking throughout, although it was a tired penalty kick he missed in the shootout.\nRob Kiernan (defender) 7\nShowed great composure at times during the game, bringing the ball down and playing it out of dangerous areas with passing triangles. Didn't play with any fear before his injury and was solid defensively.\nDanny Wilson (defender) 8\nHas improved in recent months and that showed in this game. He took charge at the back and showed maturity and composure throughout. Handled the difficult challenge of facing Griffiths well.\nLee Wallace (defender) 8\nHis energy levels were remarkable. In the first half, he and Barrie McKay were excellent as a pairing. Wallace had to defend well against Roberts, but kept to his strengths and was always bombing forward. Even in extra time he was running beyond McKay to make things happen, and was strong defensively. A consummate pro and played a captain's role.\nAndy Halliday (midfielder) 7\nScott Brown dominated the midfield in last season's Old Firm game, but Halliday stood up to him, got tackles in and got the fans going. He also showed a good range of passing. Set the tone for Rangers early on with his energy and assertiveness and took responsibility by scoring Rangers' opening penalty in the shootout.\nDominic Ball (midfielder) 7\nPlayed in the holding role and was booked in the second half so will miss the final. Stefan Johansen created a couple of openings early on, but Ball was solid and kept the play moving. Looked comfortable when he switched to centre-back after Kiernan was injured.\nJason Holt (midfielder) 7\nNice and bright in possession throughout, and was always looking to link up with the forwards in the final third. Also didn't neglect his defensive duties. His performance was like his season: consistent.\nDean Shiels (forward) 7\nWas asked to play in a position that is not his strongest, wide on the right. Tracked back and performed diligently, while contributing to Rangers' good possession in the first half.\nKenny Miller (forward) 7\nEarly on, his intelligent run beyond Charlie Mulgrew delivered a chance and Craig Gordon had to save well. That's typical Miller, he sniffs out a chance and is always on the move. Took his goal well, tucking it away as he has done all his career. Typically sharp and hard working.\nBarrie McKay (forward) 9\nEven prior to the goal, he was Rangers' best player. Early on, he and Wallace combined well down the left, as Rangers took the game to Celtic. Has quick feet and glides past players. Gave Mikael Lustig a hard game. Always looked after the ball and scored an outstanding goal.\nNicky Law (midfielder) 6\nIt's always difficult to come into a game like this as a substitute. He was also asked to play in an unfamiliar position wide on the right. Will be disappointed to have let Kieran Tierney in to cross for Celtic's equaliser but he atoned in the shootout, with a cool penalty.\nGedion Zelalam (midfielder) 6\nFilled in when Ball had to move into defence and tried to keep play moving. Showed composure in the shootout to score a pressure penalty.\nNicky Clark (forward) 6\nWorked hard and showed good energy when he replaced Miller. Stepped up during the shootout but saw his effort saved\nCraig Gordon (goalkeeper) 7\nDid everything he was asked to do during the game. He didn't have any chance with either of the Rangers goals, but gave Celtic hope in the shootout when he saved Clark's penalty.\nMikael Lustig (defender) 6\nThe Sweden international had a hard time against Barrie McKay, particularly in the first half. He also didn't link up well with Patrick Roberts in front of him, and McKay and Wallace were able to get in a few times.\nDedryck Boyata (defender) 5\nOnly played for 23 minutes before leaving the field with an injury. Still made a couple of mistakes in that time, being caught in possession and having to commit a foul to halt a Rangers attack.\nCharlie Mulgrew (defender) 6\nHe was steady throughout the game at centre-back, and showed his experience. Didn't do anything wrong, and was fine in possession. Stepped up to take a penalty in the shootout.\nKieran Tierney (defender) 8\nClearly Celtic's best player. At times he was up against two Rangers players, but still able to handle both of them very well. Worked up and down the pitch, showed good defensive instincts and still had the legs and the wherewithal to create the equaliser late on in extra time with a great cross for Tom Rogic.\nScott Brown (midfielder) 7\nAnother steady performer for Celtic. At the start of the second half, when Celtic needed to up the tempo, he pushed further forward and helped to haul his side back into the game. He did what was asked of him.\nNir Bitton (midfielder) 6\nIn extra time he was signalling that he had a hamstring injury and needed to come off. But he stayed on the pitch, kept playing on and then stepped up to take a spot-kick. For all his ability, though, he was still too quiet at times.\nGary Mackay-Steven (forward) 5\nCouldn't really get into the game. Celtic did not use him that much, but in that case he then has to go looking for the ball, and demand to receive it. The game passed him by.\nStefan Johansen (midfielder) 5\nDidn't deliver enough on the day. With his talent, he should have been more influential, but that's been the story of this season for the Norwegian international.\nPatrick Roberts (forward) 6\nShould have equalised in the first half when faced with an open goal and had another scoring opportunity in the second half on his right foot, so missed big chances. Great delivery for the corner kick that Erik Sviatchenko scored from, but he tired late on.\nLeigh Griffiths (forward) 6\nNot one of his better games, looked jaded and could have worked the Rangers centre-backs more. He didn't get the right supply, but still managed to hit the post and then the bar late on with a magnificent free-kick which could have won the game.\nErik Sviatchenko (defender) 7\nScored a powerful header and had two more on target. Did OK defensively and shored Celtic up; his partnership alongside Mulgrew looked stronger.\nCallum McGregor (midfielder) 6\nWas busy when he came on, without influencing the outcome of the game. Also missed one of the spot kicks.\nTom Rogic (midfielder) 7\nScored a great goal and made things happen when he came on. Had more of an impact than the other substitutes, but missed the critical spot-kick and that will haunt him.",
    "A statement announced the formation of a joint operations room following what it said was an increase in attacks on residential areas and displaced people.\nRebels were said to have subsequently launched attacks in the province of Latakia and in neighbouring Hama.\nMeanwhile, the Syrian opposition delegation in Geneva said it intended to suspend formal peace talks.\nThe cessation of hostilities brokered by the US and Russia to make way for the talks has resulted in a significant reduction in violence since it took effect on 27 February.\nBut escalating fighting in recent days, particularly around the divided northern city of Aleppo, has left it on the verge of collapse.\n\"After the increase of violations by regime forces that included targeting displaced people and continuous bombing of residential neighbourhoods, we declare the start of the battle in response,\" said the rebel statement issued on Monday morning.\nThe text was signed by the powerful Islamist groups Ahrar al-Sham and Jaysh al-Islam, as well as several groups that fight under the banner of the Free Syrian Army.\nLater in the day, the Syrian opposition negotiating team, the High Negotiations Committee (HNC), said it \"intended to postpone formal participation\" in the peace talks, UN Special Envoy to Syria Staffan de Mistura said.\nEver since Syria's truce came into force in late February, there have been repeated violations. But these new attacks are the most significant yet - rebel forces are attacking key front lines, and there have been repeated air strikes by the Syrian military.\nThis upsurge in fighting is putting new pressure on fragile peace talks. Opposition delegates are now discussing if the time has come to leave Geneva - they are reported to have received a letter from rebel forces on the ground, urging them to exert more pressure on the UN envoy Staffan de Mistura who has been mediating in these indirect negotiations between the warring sides.\nThe opposition is now accusing the UN of bias after Mr de Mistura floated a proposal to allow Syria's President Assad  to remain in office, in a ceremonial role.\nI've heard that idea in recent months from Russian and Iranian sources. But Syrian opposition groups have flatly rejected it - their Western backers are urging them not to walk out but it is becoming increasingly clear that these talks are not going anywhere.\nThe HNC wanted to express its disappointment at the deterioration in the humanitarian situation and in the cessation of hostilities, Mr de Mistura said.\nBut the envoy added that the HNC would remain in Geneva and informal discussions with the two sides would continue with a view to \"taking stock\" on Friday.\nThe US on Monday called on Russia to use its influence on the Syrian government to stop attacks that threatened the seven-week cessation of hostilities as well as the Geneva peace talks, a State Department official said.\nSeparately, President Barack Obama and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin held an \"intense conversation\" on Monday that covered Syria, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said.\nMeanwhile, four Syrians including three children in the Turkish town of Kilis were killed in rocket fire from Syrian territory controlled by co-called Islamic State (IS), the local governor's office said.\nThe Turkish military fired artillery in response, Hurriyet newspaper reported.\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that rebels had launched an assault on the positions of government forces and their allies in Latakia's northern countryside early on Monday and by midday had made advances.\nThe UK-based monitoring group also said rebels were close to taking over the town of Khirbat al-Naqus, in the strategically important Sahl al-Ghab plain in the north-west of Hama province.\nA Syrian military source confirmed the attacks, according to the Reuters news agency.\nLatakia is the heartland of President Bashar al-Assad's Alawite sect, and the Sahl al-Ghab lies just to the east of the coastal mountains where Mr Assad's ancestral village of Qardaha is located.\nMeanwhile, the Syrian Observatory said four people were killed in heavy government air strikes in northern Homs province.\nTwenty-two civilians were killed over the weekend in Aleppo, with at least 16 dying as a result of rebel shell- and sniper-fire and the six others dying in government air strikes, according to the group.\nMilitants from the group known as Islamic State (IS), which along with the rival jihadist group al-Nusra Front is excluded from the cessation of hostilities, have meanwhile seized more territory from rebel groups near the Turkish border north of Aleppo, forcing some 35,000 civilians to flee towards the opposition-held town of Azaz.\nMedecins Sans Frontieres warned on Monday that the situation was now critical for more than 100,000 displaced people trapped around Azaz, with active fighting just 7km (four miles) away and the border closed for all but the most seriously ill Syrians.",
    "Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the two sides \"disagree on the facts, the narrative and the responsibilities\" on Ukraine.\nRelations between Russia and the West have been tense since Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea region in 2014.\nRussia's envoy also criticised Nato for a military exercise in the Baltic.\nWednesday's talks in Brussels ran more than 90 minutes over schedule.\n\"Many allies disagree when Russia tries to portray [the Ukraine conflict] as a civil war,\" Mr Stoltenberg told a new conference.\n\"This is Russia destabilising eastern Ukraine, providing support for the separatists, munitions, funding, equipment and also command and control.\"\nHe added: \"Nato and Russia have profound and persistent differences. Today's meeting did not change that.\"\nMr Stoltenberg said it was important to keep channels of communication open \"to discuss our differences and to reduce the risk of military incidents\".\nHe also said that the two sides had agreed on the importance of implementing the Minsk peace agreement, which has produced a fragile truce in eastern Ukraine.\nRussia's envoy to Nato, Alexander Grushko, said a US guided-missile destroyer had sailed near the Russian port of Kaliningrad last week in an attempt \"to exercise military pressure on Russia\".\n\"We will take all necessary measures, precautions to compensate these attempts to use military force,\" he said.\nIn last week's incident, two Russian warplanes flew close to the US destroyer almost a dozen times in international waters in the Baltic Sea.\nUS officials described it as \"an aggressive act\".\nThe Nato-Russia Council was established in 2002. Although meetings at ambassadorial level have not taken place since June 2014, there has been other political dialogue.\nUkraine and the West accuse Russia of covertly backing the rebels who now control much of eastern Ukraine. Russia strongly denies the claims.\nNato has since moved to bolster its forces in its east European member states to counter what it says is a Russian military build-up.\nRussia has described Nato's increasing presence in eastern Europe as a threat to its national security.",
    "\"There's a lot going on right now,\"  the singer tells us. And she's not wrong.\nThe follow-up to her Mercury Prize-nominated debut, 2013's Sing To The Moon, is imminent. Second album The Dreaming Room is due in June and her newest track Phenomenal Woman has just debuted as Annie Mac's hottest record on BBC Radio 1.\n\"And then we have probably the most important live moment on TV in this country today,\" she adds.\n\"It's all potentially extremely exciting - and that just means that I'm naturally terrified.\"\nThe singer's struggles with stage fright and anxiety are well-documented and live TV is a particular fear.\nDescribing the concept as \"just hellish\", she tells us: \"I'd rather die. That's how I feel sometimes - I think, 'if I dropped dead I wouldn't have to do it!'.\"\nSo, it's perhaps surprising that the singer let us tag along as she kicked off the new series of Later... with Jools Holland. But it seems BBC Two's esteemed music show has a special place in her heart.\n\"In the musician's world, you say 'Jools Holland' and all of a sudden you've got massive respect - it's like saying you got Glastonbury.\"\nHer third time on Later... she calls respected musician and presenter Holland a \"genuine champion\".\n\"He called me this afternoon just to say that he'd been listening to my new record and he wanted to tell me specifically what song and what parts and why.\n\"I tell you, in the TV world, it's not the kind of place where there's room for those kind of genuine interactions, just because there's so much pressure on everyone. It's very special.\"\nHere the diary of Laura's day.\nTour manager Paul picks us up in sunny east London. Laura's assistant Mariama is laden with popcorn and snacks as we pile into the silver Mercedes van bound for the studios in Kent. The singer takes some me-time behind her shades, safe in the knowledge it's going to be a long day.\n\"I'm such a weird person to be around before anything big,\" she admits.\n\"I can't normally talk, so my team tend to just leave me to it, but I'll pick up.\n\"Right now I want to be jumping up, but you don't want to celebrate before the main event, so I'm just trying to be as relaxed as I can.\"\nWe arrive to the sounds of Kano and his brass section sound-checking. He's on the bill along with Paul Simon, The Coral, Jason Isbell and Lake Street Dive.\nLaura has the honour of opening and closing both the live and pre-recorded shows, something she says she's \"glad you only find out on the day\".\n\"I'm doing Phenomenal Woman, Kiss My Feet - which the Jools team requested - and Overcome, the first single, which featured Nile Rogers.\n\"I wanted to explode back onto the scene with something that was captivating in a much rawer and darker way. That's why there's dance and so much movement this time around, and why it's such a visual album.\"\nBackstage the band are split across two dressing rooms - one for the boys and one for the girls, where we're quickly made welcome as they debate which of the many black items of clothing they've brought will get worn.\n\"There's nine of us - it's huge by pop terms, but I refused to compromise,\" says Laura.\n\"With Sing To The Moon, six of us were trying to sound like an orchestra and a choir. It was a stress.\n\"My sister Dionne went from violin to guitar - literally learnt the guitar [and] is killing it - my brother's playing cello. It feels much more like a band than me trying to do the solo artist thing. We feel like a really solid family.\"\nStill in her fur-lined boots and denim dress from the journey, Laura and the band head to the camera rehearsal. Jools arrives and gives Laura a hug, waving hello to the production team. Giant white cue cards are being written to help him introduce the acts.\nRunning through each of their tracks twice, Laura sports her new keytar in place of her trademark piano.\n\"Lady Mariama was up until 4am trying to make my keytar white. I mean what the hell is that about?\" she laughs.\n\"Initially it was a joke idea, I was just messing about jamming with it, but it made so much sense. I'm not stuck behind anything in a static way anymore, I can move and I can see people. If I want to turn and feel the band I can do that. We have such a good time now.\"\nTime for some nourishment. The team (\"there's like millions of them... making it work\") are handed pocket money for the canteen, while Laura retreats to her dressing room. As well as make-up, wardrobe and calming those nerves, she also has a TV interview to fit in.\n\"I used to not eat, I couldn't eat. But I've learned to, so you don't drop off after one song. I have meatballs and sweet potato fries. And a balance of water and red wine.\"\n\"[Designer] Alex Noble has done a lot of my clothes recently,\" says Laura. \"He is just on another planet. He text me yesterday and I was just weeping emojis because the clothes are just... I mean you'll see with the outfit tonight.\n\"I made a visual essay for the album, this massive book [filled with] images, as stimulus for new music but also to help anybody I might be collaborating with. Stylists or people in the label, anyone could take the book and go 'oh yeah, I'm listening and I'm looking'.\n\"It means I get to talk less. That's probably surprising to some people because I do love to natter! But it helps.\"\nMinutes before show time, Laura's designer and assistant are still huddled together in one of the dressing rooms with a needle and thread and the singer's fabulous outfit in their hands.\nShe's set to do an interview at Jools's famous piano, but the purple corset she'll be wearing (with matching super-flared trousers) will be too tight to sit down in. Cue furious unpicking and re-stitching. Eventually it's decided she'll do the interview standing up. Problem solved.\nWith the audience in place and schooled on how to cheer and clap in the correct manner, Laura's up first - opening the pre-recorded show with Maya Angelou-inspired anthem Phenomenal Woman.\n\"If you're first out of the blocks - you're the thing in the room that makes the first sound. I've been second and third before and everybody breathes when the sound's been made,\" says Laura.\nThere's mild panic when the lighting desk freezes after The Coral perform, but after a few minutes of confusion they're rolling again.\nLater, a respectful hush descends as Paul Simon performs Sounds Of Silence in the centre of the studio.\n\"He made me cry so much,\" says Laura. \"I kept thinking, 'why didn't I bring Mum to this gig?'. She was raised on Simon and Garfunkel.\n\"I ended up thinking about my whole life, my creative life... what is this all about? Here I am literally stood in front of Mr Paul Simon.\"\nWith all the stars limbered up (and the shortest of toilet breaks), the second show goes live on BBC Two.\n\"It's an amazing feeling because you know that it's happening now and everybody's tuned in, but at the same time - the fear and the dread. You can't correct anything, so whatever comes out is it. \"\nLaura ends the live show on a high with Phenomenal Woman.\n\"That for me was surprisingly wonderful, because live television literally - there's nothing that I'm more terrified of! And the live performance was better than the pre-record - what?!\"\nIt's all over. The audience files out and the set's dismantled as artists and their teams pack up their gear and rush to congratulate each other.\nUS outfit Lake Street Dive collar Laura for a picture, while she and sister Dionne seek out Kano for a snap (\"Because he's fine. And obviously amazing\").\n\"I always forget how emotionally exhausting it is,\" says Laura.\n\"The amount I invest into any performance is always bucket loads of sweat or tension that doesn't get released until I'm in that moment.\n\"That's the uniqueness of a show like Jools's - you are getting that concentrated performance.\"\nSo what now?\n\"Everybody laughs at me because I literally make a beeline for my bed after. I'll probably eat again later because I always get a major appetite, which is why I have this thing [grabs belly area] that will never go away.\n\"But yeah, I just conk out. If I think about stuff I'll go nuts, because you've just put something out.\n\"I mean I haven't had a child, but I imagine - like when you have a baby - it's out there. I can't push it back in!\"\nYou can catch the extended edition of Later... with Jools Holland on BBC Two on Friday 22 April at 23:15 BST or watch Tuesday night's live episode on the iPlayer now.",

    "The technique is being hailed as a breakthrough in understanding how the trillions of complex cells in a body are descended from a single egg.\n\"It has the potential to provide profound insights into how normal, diseased or damaged tissues are constructed and maintained,\" one UK biologist told the BBC.\nThe work appears in Science journal.\nThe human body has around 40 trillion cells, each with a highly specialised function. Yet each can trace its history back to the same starting point - a fertilised egg.\nDevelopmental biology is the business of unravelling how the genetic code unfolds at each cycle of cell division, how the body plan develops, and how tissues become specialised. But much of what it has revealed has depended on inference rather than a complete cell-by-cell history.\n\"I actually started working on this problem as a graduate student in 2000,\" confessed Jay Shendure, lead researcher on the new scientific paper.\n\"Could we find a way to record these relationships between cells in some compact form we could later read out in adult organisms?\"\nThe project failed then because there was no mechanism to record events in a cell's history.\nThat changed with recent developments in so called CRISPR gene editing, a technique that allows researchers to make much more precise alterations to the DNA in living organisms.\nThe molecular tape recorder developed by Prof Shendure's team at the University of Washington in Seattle, US, is a length of DNA inserted into the genome that contains a series of edit points which can be changed throughout an organism's life.\nEach edit records a permanent mark on the tape that is inherited by all of a cell's descendants. By examining the number and pattern of all these marks in an adult cell, the team can work back to find its origins.\nDevelopmental biologist James Briscoe of the Crick Institute, in London, UK, calls it \"a creative and exciting use\" of the CRISPR technique.\n\"It uniquely and indelibly marks cells with a 'barcode' that is inherited in the DNA. This means you can use the barcode to trace all the progeny of barcoded cells,\" he said.\nJay Shendure collaborated with molecular biologist Alex Schier of Harvard University to prove the technique on a classic lab organism - the zebrafish.\nNot only did they show the technique works, they could trace the lineage of hundreds of thousands of cells in mature fish. They also showed it has the power to change perceptions about biological development.\n\"We can look at individual organs - say the left eye or the right eye, or the gills or the heart,\" Prof Shendure explained in an interview with the BBC's Science in Action radio programme, \"and the real surprise was that in every organ we looked at, the majority of the organ came from just a handful of progenitor cells.\"\nFor example, although they identified over a thousand cell lineages within one of their fish, it took only five of them to create most of the blood cells. The surprise is evident in the published paper, which includes a few suggested explanations. James Briscoe also finds the discovery remarkable.\n\"It's striking that a barcode found in one organ was rarely found in another,\" he wrote in an e-mail, adding that in the early embryo, cells are often mobile and so a richer mix could be expected. An unexpectedly small group of \"founder cells\" would be one explanation.\nOr \"there could be many founding cells, from different lineages (barcodes), at early embryonic stages, but many of these lineages die off as the tissue develops.\"\nFurther experiments with the technique could unwrap the details. But the fact that a simple, profound question was immediately thrown up by the new technique shows just how powerful it is.\nAnd the technique does not have to be limited to healthy development.\n\"Cancers develop by a lineage, too,\" Alex Schier told the BBC. \"Our technique can be used to follow these lineages during cancer formation - to tell us the relationships of cells within a tumour, and between the original tumour and secondary tumours formed by metastasis.\"\nAnd Prof Shendure points out that many inherited diseases develop because of faulty genetic programming.\n\"Many of these may well have their basis in the skewing of the cell lineage,\" he explained.\nThe technique comes with the somewhat tortured acronym GESTALT - the German for \"shape\". It is easy to use, and could easily be improved, says Jay Shendure. James Briscoe is already thinking of ways to use it with his experimental animals - mice.\nFor developmental biology, GESTALT could be the shape of things to come.",
    "Almost 8,000 real words - and invented ones - are included in the dictionary, which has taken five years to compile.\nDahl famously invented words to stop his readers getting so bored they closed their books and watched TV.\nGumplewink, grobbled and sleep squiggler were unused but found in his archive during research for the book.\nWith his love of wordplay, Dahl would scribble his words on yellow pages from the American legal pads he used to write in, swapping letters around and adopting spoonerisms and malapropisms.\nThe Oxford Roald Dahl Dictionary, which features Dahl's long-time illustrator Sir Quentin Blake, was compiled by lexicographer Dr Susan Rennie.\nListen to Michael Rosen's interview with Dr Rennie on Radio 4's Word of Mouth.\nSome of Dahl's other words include:\nDr Rennie said Dahl built his new words on familiar sounds, adding: \"He didn't always explain what his words meant, but children can work them out because they often sound like a word they know, and he loved using onomatopoeia.\n\"For example, you know that something lickswishy and delumptious is good to eat, whereas something uckyslush or rotsome is definitely not.\n\"He also used sounds that children love to say, like squishous and squizzle, or fizzlecrump and fizzwiggler, which makes his stories so much fun to read, whatever age you are,\" she added.\nAnd Dr Rennie told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the vast majority are either words Dahl invented, or \"existing words that he used in interesting ways in his works\".\nShe said: \"Some of them have already escaped Dahl's world, like scrumdiddlyumptious. Children use Dahl's words a lot in their own writing and also create words inspired by the way he built words.\n\"He sometimes pulled the syllables of words apart and rebuilt them, combined them, and we can see children doing that in their own writing.\"\nSome of the words in the dictionary reflect exclamations or phrases that may appear somewhat arcane today, such as ruddy, blithering, breeches and lavatory, which would have been familiar to the educated middle and upper classes of the 1940s.\nDahl also slipped biographical details into his stories, such as Matilda's parrot called Chopper, which was the name of his own Jack Russell dog.\nMatilda actually means \"mighty in battle\" and was often used as a name for the tanks used in North Africa during World War Two, in which Dahl served as an RAF pilot.\nLuke Kelly, managing director of the Roald Dahl Literary Estate, and Roald Dahl's grandson, said: \"Roald Dahl's inventive, playful use of language is a key element to his writing, so it is wonderful to have this dictionary compiled with such expertise, passion, and wit.\n\"I hope it serves as a swashboggling source of inspiration for a whole new generation of storytellers.\"\nDahl's first children's story, James and the Giant Peach, was published in 1961 and was a hit. Every subsequent book became a bestseller, including Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Fantastic Mr Fox and the BFG.\nHis books are available in 58 languages and more than 200 million have sold worldwide, with many adapted for stage and screen.\nHis next story to hit cinemas will be Steven Spielberg's adaptation of The BFG, starring Mark Rylance, which is set for release in July.\nThe dictionary is published on 2 June.",

The odds of winning are only slightly better than the odds of guessing the mobile phone numbers of the next two strangers you see in the street. The UK does not send \u00a350 million a day to the EU.\nBut, as the Reality Check team have been finding out, the chances of winning are staggeringly small.\nThere are a total of 36 games in the group stage of the tournament and 15 knockout matches.\nThe odds of correctly forecasting all 51 games randomly are a sextillion to one.\nNow, your in-depth knowledge of European football may tip the odds more in your favour, but remember you also have to guess which teams will qualify from the group stages.\nThe finals feature 24 teams for the first time and with 16 of them qualifying for the first knockout round, the results are harder to predict.\nEven if you had a 70% chance of getting each one right, the odds are probably about one in 80,000,000 - quite a bit worse than your chances of winning the lottery (45,000,000 to one since you ask).\nVote Leave recognise that the odds are slim but campaign director Dominic Cummings defended the contest, saying: \"We want everyone to have the chance to win the sort of money most people can only dream of, unless they are a banker or a Euro MP.\"\nFor the record, MEPs earn 8,213 euros (about \u00a36,250) per month.\nTo qualify for the prize, participants have to enter their phone number, together with their email and home addresses, with a Vote Leave source admitting it would allow them to gather the contact details of thousands of potential voters.\nWill Straw, executive director of Britain Stronger In Europe, described the competition as a \"con\".\nBut Vote Leave's privacy policy allows anyone to \"opt out\" from receiving campaign information \"at any time\".\nOdds aside, Vote Leave have based their competition prize figure on the assertion that the UK sends \u00a350m a day - or \u00a3350m a week to the EU. They've been sharply reprimanded for this by Sir Andrew Dilnot, the chairman of the UK Statistics Authority for using it. He described it as \"misleading\" and said it \"undermines trust in official statistics\".\nWe've looked into this claim before and concluded that once you allow for the rebate and money that comes back to the UK for things like farming subsidies, the UK sends roughly \u00a323 million a day to the EU.\nThis would be a very tidy lump sum but not nearly as generous as the amount that Vote Leave is offering.\nRead more: The facts behind claims in the EU debate",

It proves that nothing is already written in football, and it is on the field where you have to make your point.\n\"In a tournament like this, you need an alchemy, of people who get on well together and the biggest satisfaction for me tonight is to see how happy they all were, also those on the bench.

    "First Minister Nicola Sturgeon will confirm the plans when she addresses the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) congress in Glasgow on Monday.\nShe will tell delegates that discussions will begin over the summer with the aim of putting health staffing on a statutory basis.\nThe RCN welcomed the promise but said it would only work if backed up with funding for extra staff.\nThe first minister will tell the congress that the planned legislation will reinforce patient safety.\nShe is expected to say: \"Since this government came to power in 2007 there are more than 2,300 extra qualified nurses and midwives working in our NHS.\n\"In addition to having record staffing levels, Scotland has led the UK in the development of mandatory nursing and midwifery workload and workforce planning tools that help health boards to plan for the number of staff they require.\n\"By using these tools, health boards can make sure they have the right number of staff to provide the best possible care for patients in a variety of specialities.\n\"To build on our record, we will enshrine these planning tools in law and examine what other areas of the workforce would benefit from having similar tools developed, which will further strengthen our commitment to patient safety in our wards.\"\nChief nursing officer Prof Fiona McQueen added: \"The link between safe and sustainable staffing levels - including qualified nurse numbers - and high quality care is well established.\n\"It's vital to have the right number of staff in place, with the right skills. We already have building blocks in place in Scotland to achieve this, including evidence-based planning tools and enhanced training.\"\nTheresa Fyffe, president of RCN Scotland, said the statutory staffing requirement would be welcome if it was backed up with funding.\nShe said: \"The challenge is going to be the financial pressures we are under right now.\n\"So having mandated staffing levels will be good but if there isn't the finance to pay for the staffing, you end with the pressure being felt back at the (health) boards and it doesn't really resolve the problem.\"\nScottish Labour said it was a \"worthwhile commitment\" that it would support but also emphasised the need for funding.\nThe party's health spokesman, Anas Sarwar, said: \"Just one third of our hard working and dedicated NHS staff think they have enough colleagues to do their job properly.\n\"Doctors, nurses, auxiliaries and others are under enormous pressure and are increasingly being asked to do more with less.\"\nHe added: \"Given that NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde alone faces making cuts of \u00c2\u00a369m, the SNP government must ensure this isn't just an attempt to get a good headline.\n\"We need ministers to take decisions for the long term, so we have a health service fit for the future, delivering for the public and respecting its staff.\"",

    "A Leave vote was always seen as more likely to generate significant disturbances in the financial world.\nFor that reason it is also the result which was thought more likely to pose a headache for the world's central banks.\nThere have already been statements from some that they are prepared to act to maintain financial stability.\nThere are two potential issues they might want to respond to in the short term: the stability of the (commercial) banks and swings in exchange rates.\nWith the banks there is a possibility of a general rise in risk aversion, and some might have difficulty borrowing in the inter-bank market. The ultimate danger from that is that they might be unable to make debt payments as they come due.\nCentral banks can address that by lending them extra money (liquidity). In the UK the Bank of England has already been doing this ahead of the referendum, hoping to ensure that there is sufficient liquidity already in place. The Bank has said it \"will continue to monitor market conditions carefully and keep its operations under review\".\nOther central banks will be ready to take similar action if they think it's needed.\nWhat if the strains show up in terms of foreign currency liquidity - say an Italian bank needing quick access to Swiss francs?\nThere are arrangements known as swap lines put in place during the international financial crisis that can be used if necessary. The Italian bank could then get Swiss francs from the European Central Bank (ECB), (and the Swiss National Bank would be able to offer euros to Swiss banks if needed). The Bank of England is involved in these arrangements so it can get foreign currency if British banks were to need it urgently.\nWith sharp moves in exchange rates, there are several options. They could just live with it. But if they felt the swings were too sharp and destabilising they could intervene using their foreign currency reserves.\nIn the case of the UK, the decision to conduct such intervention is for the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, with the Bank of England carrying it out in the markets.\nSo if there were too precipitous a fall in the value of one currency (sterling would be the obvious candidate in the event of a leave vote) the Bank of England could buy sterling with dollars or yen from its reserves, hoping the additional demand for the pound would support its value.\nConversely the Swiss National Bank has been worried about too rapid a rise in the Swiss franc and has already been into the markets to buy other currencies such as the euro with its own national currency.\nFurther action on these lines is a possibility. Currencies seen as havens are susceptible to unwanted sharp rises in times of financial stress and the Swiss franc is a prime example of that.\nCurrency market intervention is often not announced. Some observers say there is evidence suggesting that the Swiss central bank might have intervened over the past week.  The intervention after the vote by the SNB was announced however.\nInterest rates can also be used to curb currency moves - a cut to stop a currency rising; a rate rise to prevent a fall.\nBoth options, interest rate moves and intervention, can be co-ordinated by central banks.\nFurther quantitative easing (QE) is also a possible response to a rising currency. It tends to drive down market interest rates and there has been some speculation that it might be on the agenda very soon,  perhaps from the Bank of Japan (which does not want to see the yen gaining value).\nInterest rate moves and QE can also be used to address longer term fallout - to tackle any impact on inflation or growth. The Bank of England has scope to cut rates further and it could undertake further QE. A fall in sterling would be inflationary, though up to a point that could be welcome as inflation is currently (at 0.3%) far below the Bank's target (2%).\nAnother risk is that in a general flight from riskier assets the government debt problem in the eurozone could return, pushing up borrowing costs for countries such as Spain and Italy that were in the firing line a few years ago.\nThose earlier eurozone storms abated after the ECB announced that it was prepared in some circumstances to buy the bonds, the debts, of governments severely affected. In the event it never used this new weapon. The mere threat of doing so was enough to settle the eurozone bond market.\nSome observers, such as the London consultancy Capital Economics, think it could finally use this programme, if the aftermath of a leave vote were sufficiently disruptive.\nThe likely timescale for these options varies.  In principle many could be done very quickly. The most urgent, if needed, would probably be bank liquidity. Interest rates and QE could be announced early, but could also be used as a response to economic fallout that might emerge over a longer period.\nThe ECB's option of riding to the rescue of the likes of Spain or Italy would take some time. They would need to have an economic policy programme agreed with the rest of the eurozone. And Spain in particular, with an election this weekend, is itself in a period of political uncertainty that could make it difficult to conduct international negotiations.",

That remains to be seen.\"\nProf Koller said the technology had kept improving, but universities had been held back by the \"protection of the brand\" and not wanting to be seen to move away from personal tuition.\n\"It's the perception we need to break, it's not the technology that's been the barrier,\" she said.\nIn terms of supervising exams for distance learners, she said that webcams are \"surprisingly hard to beat\".\nProf Koller said concerns about impersonal online learning were often built on an unrealistic image of traditional campus-based teaching - and that most students are not \"walking on lawns next to ivy-clad buildings\".\n\"It's a false comparison to think it's either anonymous online teaching or else a cosy armchair and individual tutors.\n\"When you have a lecture hall with 300 people, you're not getting personal interaction.\"\nOnline learning should not be compared \"with some utopian ideal of 10 people sitting around in a seminar room engaging deeply with an instructor\".\nProf Koller says that online learning is going to become the route for students who want to improve their qualifications but who cannot afford the time or money to study for a campus-based degree.\n\"Many working adults have obligations, they have a job, a family, a mortgage, they can't go back to school.\"\nIn countries such as India, with ambitious targets to expand higher education, Prof Koller says the authorities will have to use online universities, because there is insufficient capacity in bricks-and-mortar institutions.\nThere are also efforts to use online learning to teach refugees, such as those displaced by Syria's civil war.\nCoursera has announced a partnership with the US State Department to help refugees to access online courses to improve their job chances, such as English language lessons or computer coding.\nIt would remove any costs from studying, such as fees for certificates showing the completion of courses.\nMore stories from the BBC's Global education series looking at education from an international perspective and how to get in touch\nCoursera was founded four years ago, part of a wave of online university projects that were claimed to be about to revolutionise higher education, making it cheaper and more accessible to students around the world.\nMany millions signed up for free short courses - but Prof Koller is predicting another stage with online learning being incorporated into formal fee-charging degree courses from mainstream universities.\nThere are already many online degrees offered - but Prof Koller says that in the past, such distance learning was seen as something \"respectable universities do not engage in\".\nThere are signs that this change is already beginning to happen.\nThe UK's online university platform, Futurelearn, has announced a project with the University of Leeds, in which course units studied online will count as credits towards an undergraduate degree.\nStudents from this autumn will be able to take course units online and cut the cost of tuition fees for a geography degree.\nPeter Horrocks, chairman of Futurelearn, described this as a \"breakthrough moment\".\nFuturelearn has been created by the Open University, a longstanding provider of degrees by distance learning.\nBut the big change will be if leading, campus-based universities begin to compete for mainstream, undergraduate courses online.\nAnother major US online university network, edX, is launching a project this autumn allowing online course units to be used as building blocks towards a full degree.\nEdX is offering a range of online courses from Arizona State University - and if a student passes eight of these, costing $200 (\u00c2\u00a3150) each, it counts as the equivalent of a first year at university.\nCoursera has launched two online postgraduate courses with the University of Illinois, at a much lower price than their conventional counterparts.\nProf Koller says the past four years has seen a rapid rise in the numbers of students wanting to study online, but a slower reaction from universities in offering fully fledged online courses.\n\"We thought that the change in academic institutions would be more rapid,\" she said. \"Universities are not the most nimble of organisations.\"\nThat change could now be approaching, she says, with universities working out their strategies for a potentially huge market.\nThe hype around Moocs might have faded, but the big impact could be about to begin.",
    "Media playback is not supported on this device\nKyrgios, 21, lost 7-5 6-1 6-4 to British number one Andy Murray in Monday's much-anticipated last-16 tie.\n\"I hope he sees the writing on the wall before this gets chronic and irreparable,\" the American seven-time Grand Slam champion told BBC Sport.\n\"It's not just the mental side, he needs to work harder at his game.\"\nKyrgios is the youngest player in the world top 20, but his success has been marred by questions about his attitude.\nHe rose to fame by beating Rafael Nadal at Wimbledon but has been involved in a number of controversies, such as making remarks about Stan Wawrinka's girlfriend during a match last year, resulting in a suspended 28-day ban from the Association of Tour Professionals.\n\"He doesn't understand what it takes to be someone who wins Grand Slams at this level and that is unfortunate,\" McEnroe added.\nKyrgios did not react to McEnroe's criticism, but asked if he felt he was applying himself the best he could, he replied: \"No.\"\nHe added: \"When things get tough, I'm just a little bit soft.\n\"I've got experience, but it ultimately comes down to just laying it all out there and competing for a long time. I didn't do that today at all.\n\"At times, like I've previously said, I don't love the sport. But I don't really know what else to do without it. I know that I have the talent to do good things.\n\"I woke up this morning and played computer games. Is that the greatest preparation? I don't know, but it was fun.\n\"Every time I come here, I lose to good players. But it's just disappointing. I don't know. I just want to do better.\"\nKyrgios made 19 unforced errors in the fourth-round match against Murray - three times more than the Scot - and did not earn a break point.\nThe second set lasted just 26 minutes after a tight first set, which Murray claimed by breaking Kyrgios in the 12th game.\n\"Kyrgios has to look in the mirror if he wants to become a top player and win Slams,\" said McEnroe, who was involved in a number of heated exchanges with umpires during his career.\n\"I still think he will win Slams but not how he did it there. You can't give away points and games against someone as good and focused as Murray. Inexplicable. He's got to ask himself how badly he wants to become the best player in the world.\"\nShortly before the match, Kyrgios was pictured courtside as fellow Australian Lleyton Hewitt competed in the doubles competition.\nMcEnroe said: \"What kind of preparation is that? Two hours before you're out on Centre Court you're watching a doubles match! I know you need to keep nerves down, but come on.\"\nKyrgios denied that watching compatriot Hewitt's match before taking on Murray had hindered his performance.\n\"Whether I was in the locker room sitting down or sitting down next to the court, I don't think really made a difference,\" he said.\nCompatriot Pat Cash described Kyrgios as a \"different sort of kid\" but also said he is \"definitely talented\".\nCash, the 1987 Wimbledon champion, added: \"I think that is what frustrates a lot of Australians. To see that much talent, you want it to be utilised better.\n\"I just don't think he is that type of kid. He is getting better. He is doing his best to not get in as much trouble this year, though he still has a few fines.\n\"Nick says he doesn't really love tennis and I understand that. I didn't love tennis, I was just good at it. Andre Agassi said the same thing.\"",

    "For the fifth time in six years, it earned the Buckinghamshire golfer a place at the Open Championship - no mean feat for a young man who does not turn 25 until October.\nApart from booking a spot at Royal Troon, it earned a place at his first American major - the USPGA at Baltusrol, New Jersey, at the end of July.\nAnd his Scottish Open payday of 429,468 euros represents the largest of his five-year professional career.\nDespite the frustration of seeing so many birdie chances slip away on the back nine to finish a shot behind the victorious Swede Alex Noren, Hatton told BBC Sport: \"I'm really happy with that result.\n\"Earlier on in the year, after the start I had, missing a few chances earlier on, there was a good chance my head would have gone down. But my caddie kept me upbeat and positive.\n\"Part of me is slightly disappointed in a way, one short,\" admitted the Marlow-based former Berks, Bucks and Oxon amateur Hatton, who plays at Harleyford. \"But I played well. I tried to stay as patient as I can.\"\nMost pertinently, on a day when he secured his fifth top-10 finish in 13 European Tour events in 2016, Hatton particularly showed his nerve with his birdie putt on the final green.\nThere was a lot riding on it. The difference between finishing outright second and in a four-way tie for the runners-up spot amounted to about \u00a3150,000. He kept his cool from 10 feet.\n\"That was a huge putt,\" said Hatton. \"I was really happy to see that one drop, and I holed a really good par putt on 17 as well.\n\"Second outright is my best finish on the European Tour.

    "Sir Bernard announced the move to reassure the public and deter attackers following terrorist attacks in Europe.\nThe Met has already said the number of armed officers will go up in London by 600 to 2,800.\nAnd a further 900 armed officers are planned to be in operation for the rest of England and Wales.\nBut Steve White, chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, said it may take two years to fully train the 1,500 recruits planned nationally.\n\"When you're recruiting 1,500 it's going to take a lot of time. You've got to find the resources, the facilities and the people,\" he told the BBC.\nHowever, Deputy Chief Constable Simon Chesterman, the national lead for firearms, said last month that the majority of new armed officers will be in place by April 2017.\nThe latest announcement comes after 84 people were killed when a lorry ploughed into a large crowd watching a fireworks display in Nice in the south of France last month.\nLondoners and tourists out enjoying the August sunshine in central London report mixed feelings about more armed police patrolling the city's streets.\nTeacher Julie Banks, who was visiting from Liverpool, says she finds the news reassuring, \"especially at this time of year when there are more tourists and crowds. We shouldn't be complacent\".\nRetired friends John Lee and John Coles, both from London, agree. \"It's a good thing. It's not going to stop a terror attack, but it makes people feel more secure,\" Mr Coles says.\n\"I never thought I would see the day British police carried weapons in the street like this, but I think that needs to happen now - whether we like it or not,\" Mr Lee adds.\nBricklayer Gary Johns, 34, approved, but says: \"The real question is what their response time is.\"\nOthers, however, say the sight of police carrying heavy weapons makes them uneasy. \"It makes me more nervous than secure to be honest,\" says Bryony Wood, a make-up artist, 26, from west London. \"It's a reminder of what might happen.\"\n\"I have mixed feelings about it,\" says Ebuka Orunta, 20, from south London. \"On one hand I feel safer knowing the Met has a strategy in place to mitigate the risk.\n\"On the other hand, we've seen the problems with police brutality in the US. It's important the people in charge of this weaponry are the right people who are going to protect us.\"\nSir Bernard said: \"We have no intelligence that there will be an attack shortly but what we do know is what we have seen in western Europe.\n\"We have seen attacks in Germany, in Belgium, in France and we would be foolish to ignore that, so it's important that we get officers out there with firearms to respond.\"\nThe commissioner said the increased firearms teams would be patrolling randomly around the clock.\nIt comes after he told a newspaper that a terror attack on the UK is highly likely and a case of \"when, not if\". Writing in the Mail on Sunday, the Met chief said there was a \"sense of fear\" in Britain.\nMr Khan said: \"It's really important that Londoners are reassured that the police service, that the security service, that all of us are doing our bit to keep Londoners in our city safe...\n\"The threat level hasn't changed but we are learning the lessons from Europe, from Nice, from Paris, from Munich.\"\nBy BBC home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani\nThe Metropolitan Police have long aimed to make the capital as \"hostile\" an environment as possible for any would-be attacker to carry out a mass-casualty attack.\nBut if they can't stop someone attacking, the goal is to have enough armed police available to get to the scene of an atrocity quickly to minimise casualties and neutralise the threat.\nArmed police reached the scene of the 2013 killing of Fusilier Lee Rigby 11 minutes after the 999 call. The attackers were not armed with automatic weapons and just stood there waiting for police to arrive, rather than attacking anyone else.\nClearly, in a Paris-style scenario, 11 minutes is a long, long time so a great deal of today's security planning aims to accelerate how quickly specialist firearms officers could reach a scene.\nNone of which addresses a much bigger issue: what if the attack isn't in London, Birmingham or Manchester? Major cities may be well-resourced - but preparing to respond to an incident elsewhere is far more challenging.\nThe Met said the new armed officers would be \"working alongside their neighbourhood and specialist colleagues\", and Mr Khan said there would be a second dedicated PC in every London ward by the end of next year.\nIn Munich, Germany, nine people died in a shooting at a shopping centre in July while in November 2015, gunmen and suicide bombers killed 130 people in Paris.\nMeanwhile, Mr White expressed his concern about the time it would take to put the plan in place.\n\"What we've got to make sure is that we have the resources in the right place at the right time and we've also got to recognise that this isn't London-centric... a terrorist attack could happen anywhere in the country.\"\nFirearms officers in the Metropolitan Police have to undergo a comprehensive selection and training process before they are allowed on to the streets with a gun.",

It's not just at our club, but every club. Managers play it safe and tend to go for experienced boys and they don't do that on the continent.\n\"I've been to Switzerland, I've been to Italy, to Spain, to Greece, to see how they do it.

    "People with a DNA variation in a gene called PDSS2 tend to drink fewer cups of coffee, a study carried out at the University of Edinburgh has found.\nIt suggests the gene reduces cell ability to break down caffeine.\nThis causes it to stay in the body for longer and means those with the gene get the same caffeine hit through less coffee.\nOne scientist working on the project said it suggests the \"drive to drink coffee may be embedded in our genes\".\nThe researchers studied the DNA of 370 people living in a small village in southern Italy and 843 people from six villages in north-east Italy.\nThe subjects were asked to complete a survey including a question about how many cups of coffee they drank each day.\nThe team found people with the PDSS2 DNA variation tended to consume fewer cups of coffee than people without the variation - equivalent to one fewer cup daily on average.\nResearchers replicated the study in a group of 1,731 people from the Netherlands. The result was similar but the effect of the gene on the number of cups of coffee consumed was slightly lower.\nThe scientists said the change could be down to the different styles of coffee drunk in the two countries.\nIn Italy, people tend to drink smaller cups such as espresso whereas in the Netherlands the preference is towards larger cups which contain more caffeine overall.\nDr Nicola Pirastu, a Chancellor's Fellow at the University of Edinburgh, said: \"The results of our study add to existing research suggesting that our drive to drink coffee may be embedded in our genes.\n\"We need to do larger studies to confirm the discovery and also to clarify the biological link between PDSS2 and coffee consumption.\"\nThe study is published in the journal Scientific Reports and was conducted at the universities of Edinburgh and Trieste, the Burlo Garofolo Pediatric Institute in Italy, the Erasmus Medical Centre and PolyOmica, a data analysis company based in Groningen, the Netherlands.",

    "Experts are cautious because the drug, aducanumab, is still in the early stages of development.\nBut a study in Nature has shown it is safe and hinted that it halts memory decline.\nLarger studies are now under way to fully evaluate the drug's effects.\nThe build-up of amyloid in the brain has been a treatment target for many years.\nThis study, of 165 patients, was designed to test aducanumab was safe to take.\nAfter a year of treatment, it also showed the higher the dose the stronger the effect on amyloid plaques.\nThe researchers then carried out tests on memory and found \"positive effects\".\nHowever, 40 people dropped out of the study, half because of side effects they experienced, such as headaches. These too were much more common with a higher dosage.\nThe next phase of research - phase 3 - involves two separate studies. These are recruiting 2,700 patients with very early stage Alzheimer's across North America, Europe and Asia in order to fully test the drug's effect on cognitive decline.\nDr Alfred Sandrock of the biotech company Biogen, which worked with the University of Zurich on the research, said:  \"Phase 3 really needs to be done and I hope it will confirm what we have seen in this study.\n\"One day I could envisage treating people who have no symptoms because if you have amyloid in the brain it's likely you'll develop Alzheimer's one day.\"\nHowever, there have been many disappointments in Alzheimer's drug development, and it is over a decade since the last drug for people with the condition was licensed.\nOther experts have welcomed this latest research - but with caution.\nDr David Reynolds, chief scientific officer at Alzheimer's Research UK, said the results provided \"tantalising evidence that a new class of drug to treat the disease may be on the horizon\".\nAnd Dr James Pickett, head of research at the Alzheimer's Society, added: \"What is most compelling is that more amyloid was cleared when people took higher doses of the drug.\n\"No existing treatments for Alzheimer's directly interfere with the disease process and so a drug that actually slows the progress of the disease by clearing amyloid would be a significant step.\"\nHowever, Dr Tara Spires-Jones, of the Centre for Cognitive and Neural Systems at the University of Edinburgh, said: \"I am cautiously optimistic about this treatment, but trying not to get too excited because many drugs make it through this early stage of testing then go on to fail in larger trials.\"\nAnd John Hardy, professor of neuroscience at University College London, said: \"These new data are tantalising but they are not yet definitive.\"",

    "It is a direct quote from the man himself and reads: \"I leave an institution that has the potential to reach broad audiences across the UK and abroad, through its own programmes, partnerships and online.\"\nIt's that word \"potential\" that sticks out. What does he mean \"potential\"?\nHe's talking about an institution that has developed - on his watch - from a well respected but modestly visited gallery in Pimlico to an international art megabrand boasting the most visited museum of modern art in the world (Tate Modern), two hugely popular regional galleries, a country-wide network of partnerships and a lending programme that sees Tate's collection of British art presented in major museums from Beijing to Boston.\nBy most people's reckoning, Nicholas Serota has already delivered on Tate's \"potential\".\nBut clearly, he doesn't see it that way, which is the measure of the man and an insight into why he has made such a success of his time at Tate. He doesn't do complacency.\nHis comment about \"potential\" reflects three aspects to his character: a predisposition not to blow his own trumpet, a relentless drive, and a challenging nature.\nHe doesn't want the next incumbent to think he or she has an easy ride: there is work to be done. He might be leaving, but he's setting the agenda before he goes.\nAnd who might that person be to come in and realise Tate's \"potential\"?\nThe front-runner I reckon is Maria Balshaw, who has done a splendid job as the boss of the Whitworth in Manchester, a role she's coupled with being leader of the city's cultural programme.\nThen there's Iwona Blazwick, the long-serving director of the Whitechapel Gallery in east London, who helped shape Tate Modern's curatorial philosophy when she was working for the gallery in the late '90s. She has long been tipped as Serota's successor, and the path from Whitechapel to Tate is the one he took.\nOf the internal candidates, the most obvious is Frances Morris, but she has only just taken on the job as director of Tate Modern. The recently departed Jessica Morgan could also be a contender, but again, she has barely settled into her role as the boss at the DIA Art Foundation.\nThe search team is bound to look further afield. Klaus Biesenbach from MoMA PS1 might get a call, as could super-curator Carolyn Christov-Bakargiev, and quite possibly Michael Govan of the LA County Museum.\nFinally, Tim Marlow from the Royal Academy and Matthew Slotover, the co-founder of Frieze, are both notable figures who could bring something new to the party.",

Her biopsy results showed that the tumour had now progressed to a Grade 4.  In all honesty, and in typical Anna style, she was more bothered about how we all felt than what it meant for her.\"\nMs Fulcher described Miss Swabey as \"bright, vivacious, kind, and beautiful.\"\nShe added: \"Anna was one of those to whom others are naturally drawn.\n\"She had a great sense of fun and a marvellous joie de vivre.\n\"Anna was just 23 when she was told she had a brain tumour.

    "The disease can be more serious and harder to treat than conventional, human tuberculosis.\nThe world has committed to being free of tuberculosis by 2035.\nBut bodies including the World Health Organization (WHO) say animal TB has been neglected for decades.\nRaw or unpasteurised milk is one of the most common sources of the infection.\nBut animal tuberculosis - officially known as zoonotic tuberculosis - also affects those in close contact with infected animals including vets, farmers and butchers.\nDr Francisco Olea-Popelka, from the Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease, said zoonotic tuberculosis was \"far more common than previously recognised\".\nThe best estimates suggest there are around 121,000 new cases of animal TB each year.\nThe figure is tiny compared to human TB, which is the biggest lethal infection in the world.\nBut Dr Olea-Popelka told the BBC News website: \"I think we should care.\"\n\"This is a well-known problem and has been neglected for decades, it is a disease that is preventable, treatable and curable and yet still today we have hundreds of thousands of people suffering from it.\n\"Ten thousand die every year from this disease, that's a lot of cases compared to many other diseases, why not care?\" he added.\nHe is part of a group - including the WHO, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization and the Stop TB Partnership - that has published a call to action in the Lancet Infectious Diseases medical journal.\nOne of the biggest issues the report raises is the unknown scale of the problem.\nStudies in Mexico suggest 28% of all tuberculosis cases are down to zoonotic TB but a study in India put the figure at 9% and one in children in California suggested a figure of 45%.\nDr Paula Fujiwara, from the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease, added: \"With approximately nine million individuals contracting TB globally each year, even relatively low percentages of zoonotic TB lead to large numbers of people suffering from this form of the disease.\"\n\"People living with zoonotic TB require specialized care, but in the vast majority of cases, they are not even adequately diagnosed,\" she added.\nAnimal TB is caused by Mycobacterium bovis, which is a different infection to human TB caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis.\nM. bovis is inherently resistant to one of the key drugs used to treat human TB - pyrazinamide.\nAnd Dr Olea-Popelka added: \"Once you get zoonotic TB it is often extrapulmonary TB, meaning it is not only in the lungs, but in other organs; that complicates the diagnosis and makes it more difficult to treat.\"\nHow to tackle animal tuberculosis will be one of the themes of the Union World Conference on Lung Health taking place later this month.\nDr Olea-Popelka said the key strategies for preventing zoonotic were:\nEach is easier said than done.\nFollow James on Twitter.",
    "Her admirers say she played a key role in the economic development of the southern state of Tamil Nadu - but critics say she encouraged a personality cult and fostered corruption in the state.\nOne of India's most successful actresses, her political career was marked by allegations of self-enrichment to fund an extravagant lifestyle.\nAs head of the AIADMK party, she was elected as chief minister of Tamil Nadu on four occasions, overcoming convictions and jail terms to return to office.\nJayalalitha was born on 24 February 1948 in what was then the Mysore State. Her father was a lawyer who squandered most of the family fortune and who died when she was only two years old.\nShe excelled at school and, after studying music and dance, began training as an actress. Over the ensuing three decades she became one of India's most popular, and high-profile artists, appearing in more than 140 films.\nNaturally charismatic, she was introduced to politics by the actor-turned chief minister, MG Ramachandran, with whom she starred in many of her films.\nElected to the Tamil Nadu Assembly in 1989 she took over the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Khazagham (AIADMK) party becoming the first ever woman opposition leader. A year later she became chief minister for the first time.\nShe championed the cause of the rural and urban poor by introducing subsidised food canteens, providing free laptops to thousands of school pupils and students and launching other populist schemes like giving away food mixers and grinders to families.\nMany publicly funded projects in Tamil Nadu were named after her, including a subsidy scheme, under which canteens served food at low prices.\nThey were dubbed Amma Canteens - Amma in Tamil is Mother, an honorific euphemism by which Jayalalitha was often addressed by her followers in the state.\nThese were followed by Amma Bottled Water, Amma Salt, Amma Pharmacies and subsidised Amma Cement.\nShe attracted a level of support that verged on the bizarre.\nSome followers were known to profess their loyalty through acts such as walking on hot coals or drawing her portrait with their blood and her officials were reported to prostrate themselves at her feet.\nIncidents of her loyalists setting fire to themselves whenever she faced political setbacks were not unknown.\nShe did much to encourage this cult of personality and huge cut outs of Jayalalitha  dominated the Tamil Nadu skyline.\nHer first term in office came to an abrupt end in 1996 when her party won only four seats in the Legislative Assembly and she lost her own Bargur constituency.\nThe new ruling party wasted little time in investigating allegations of corruption amongst growing concerns about her extravagant lifestyle.\nDuring one raid on her premises following a corruption allegation in 1996, police said they had found large quantities of diamond-studded gold jewellery, more than 10,000 saris and 750 pairs of shoes.\nShe was eventually charged with receiving financial incentives in a scheme to buy more than 40,000 colour televisions for local villages and served 30 days in jail.\nShe was barred from standing in the 2001 elections because she had been sentenced to five years imprisonment following allegations she had illegally obtained state-owned property\nHowever, her party swept back into power and she was reappointed chief minister despite not having been elected to the state assembly.\nAlthough her tenure was swiftly ended, her successor was effectively under her control and in 2003, when her conviction was overturned, she successfully contested a vacant assembly seat and was once more chief minister of Tamil Nadu.\nBut controversy continued to dog her. There were allegations that she used the Tamil Nadu Marketing Corporation (Tasmac) - which had a monopoly on the sale of alcohol in the state - to pay for many of her pet projects.\nThe continuing allegations seemed to do little to dim her charisma or lower her popularity.  Following the elections in April 2011, she was sworn in as chief minister for a third term.\nShe was said to nurse ambitions of a greater role in national politics. In the run-up to the 2014 Indian parliamentary elections many of her followers suggested she aspired to become India's prime minister, although she did not confirm this.\nIn 2014 she was sentenced to four years in jail after being convicted of using her position to amass a huge property portfolio as well as a collection of expensive jewellery and luxury cars. It saw her become the first Indian chief minister ever to be removed from office.\nHowever, eight months later, in May 2015, the conviction was overturned and within days she was reinstated as chief minister of Tamil Nadu.\nIn the  following year's elections she swept back into power, winning her own seat by a handsome margin and retaining the post of chief minister.\n\"Even when 10 parties allied themselves against me, I did not have a coalition and I placed my faith in God and built an alliance with the people.\" she said. \"It is clear that the people have faith in me and I have total faith in the people.\"\nJayalalitha's supporters say she was instrumental in making Tamil Nadu one of India's most economically influential states. But her critics painted her as a deeply corrupt figure who manipulated the system and saw herself as above the law.",

    "The government said that protests against the bill had given ministers \"food for thought\".\nPoland already has among the tightest abortion laws in Europe, and the proposal sought to ban all abortions unless the mother's life was at risk.\nMPs voted to reject the bill by 352 votes to 58.\nThe bill came from an anti-abortion citizens' initiative that gathered some 450,000 signatures. It was initially backed by the Catholic Church, but bishops then said they could not support one of the proposals, to jail women who had an abortion.\nPoland's tussle over abortion ban\nThe proposals were not sponsored by Poland's ruling, socially conservative Law and Justice party (PiS) and MPs were given a free vote. However, many PiS MPs initially voted to back the bill when it went before parliament last month.\nSome 100,000 people, mostly women, protested against the proposals in cities across Poland on Monday and appeared to prompt the PiS to swing against the bill, although the party promotes Catholic values.\nPrime Minister Beata Szydlo distanced herself from a change to the law and Deputy Prime Minister Jaroslaw Gowin moved to reassure women on Wednesday that a total ban would not get through.\n\"Abortion will certainly not be banned when the woman is the victim of rape or if her life or her health is in danger,\" he insisted.\nSince Law and Justice came to power last year, it has been criticised by the EU for taking control of state media appointments and for reforms to Poland's constitutional court.\nAbortion is already largely banned in Poland. The only exceptions are a severe and irreversible damage to the foetus, a serious threat to the mother's health, or if the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest.\nThe Stop Abortion campaign group wanted the ban extended to cases of rape and incest. The only exception would have been where the mother's life was in danger.\nDoctors already risk punishment if they carry out an illegal termination. But the tighter proposals would have made abortion punishable with an five-year prison term.\nIn the end this was a bill that not even the Catholic Church could support.\nJust before the vote in parliament, Poland's bishops put out a statement saying that while they opposed abortion they did not support punishing women for having the procedure.\nThe proposed ban was not popular amongst most Poles, even though some members of the right-wing ruling party initially supported it.\nThe scale of Monday's protests clearly gave Law and Justice food for thought, and the education and science minister Jaroslaw Gowin spoke about a lesson in humility.\nAfter the vote, Prime Minister Beata Szydlo said a pro-life education campaign would be prepared instead.\nIt seems that a 23 year-old compromise, which only allows abortion in cases of rape or incest or when the health of the mother or foetus is seriously endangered, will remain in place.",

It isn't the roar of the fans, because even the Barmy Army decided not to risk coming to Dhaka. What you hear is the scream of sirens.\nIn Bangladesh, the England team bus travels with a phalanx of motorcycle outriders and a fleet of police cars jammed full of heavily armed officers.\nThe ECB's security team gave Bangladesh the all clear but the authorities here don't want to take any chances. An incident-free England tour will be evidence to the world that Bangladesh isn't as dangerous as many fear. Any attack would be a disaster for the reputation of the country.\nBut there is a risk that the small army guarding the cricket - not to mention the elaborate drills the Bangladeshis carried out inside a cricket stadium, complete with helicopters and a litter of pretend corpses - exaggerates the dangers to foreign visitors.\nThis is not a country in the grip of fear. Out on the streets of Dhaka the atmosphere is just as friendly and welcoming as I've always found it.\nThat said, earlier in the week I stopped for a cup of strong sweet tea at a stall in a busy market.\n\"Aren't you worried?\", asked the chaiwala - the tea man.\n\"Why?\", I asked.\n\"Because you are the only white man here.\"\nI looked around. He was right.\nOn Thursday, the team watched the evacuation rehearsal inside the stadium led by the Rapid Action Battalion, the special security force of the Bangladesh police.\n\"It's quite eye-opening and something you hope we will never ever have to see for real,\" said Buttler. \"It's a shock and it's sad that it has to be there.\n\"Everything has been in good order. Travel to and from the ground has been great for us although I'm sure it's been a bit frustrating for the locals.\n\"Security has been great so far, I think the guys within the group haven't even mentioned it.\"\nButtler leads England for the first time in a one-day international as the team look to make amends for the 15-run defeat by Bangladesh in Adelaide that knocked them out of the World Cup last year.\nEngland have been in superb form since the World Cup, but Buttler believes the tourists will be underdogs against a team who have won their last six ODI series on home soil.\n\"There's no real motivation for revenge,\" said Buttler. \"It's going to be a fantastic challenge for us as a group, this journey that the ODI side has been on in the last two years, it's a different one that lost to Bangladesh in the World Cup in Australia.\n\"It's not going to be easy for us. Bangladesh are very strong at home in their own conditions, and you look at the recent successes they've had in the ODI series.

    "Inciting people to harass others online, known as virtual mobbing, could also result in court action, under new Crown Prosecution Service guidance.\nThe director of public prosecutions said it means the CPS would prosecute just as if offences occurred offline.\nBut she stressed this did not mean prosecutors could \"stifle free speech\".\nThe new guidance aims to help police identify online crimes more easily.\nIt also highlights those who post people's personal information, such as bank details - known as doxxing.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said: \"The internet's not an anonymous place where people can post without any consequences. People should think about their own conduct.\n\"If you are grossly abusive to people, if you are bullying or harassing people online, then we will prosecute in the same way as if you did it offline.\"\nHowever, Ms Saunders said context will be an important factor in decisions - for example \"if you're offensive, the legislation would say you have to be grossly offensive, and that's quite a high test\".\nOne woman, who wished to remain anonymous, said she and her daughter, who has Down's Syndrome, had suffered such severe online abuse over the last six years that they had to move house three times.\nThe abuse started, she said, when a friend wrote a book about trolls - anonymously but mentioning her by name.\n\"The trolls photoshopped images of myself and my daughter on to pornography and posted it on Facebook. They have said I'm a paedophile and called her hateful names like mongoloid; they even set up a website in her name.\"\nThe woman believes the trolls kept getting hold of her details using official forms she submitted when complaining at the use of images of her daughter.\n\"Even after we moved, they have called us at three of four in the morning threatening to petrol-bomb our house if we will not give up the name of the author.\n\"It's been horrific - this trolling is not free speech; it's hate speech,\" she said.\nShe added that one of the men stood outside the family home and followed her daughter to school, taking pictures.\nThe incidents are now being investigated by police.\nKevin Healey told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme he had been abused online for five years over his autism campaign work.\nHe said: \"Not even one troll has been prosecuted or jailed, even though I have made complaints to Twitter and the police.\n\"It's been a nightmare; it's been horrific - it doesn't go away. It's with you 24 hours and seven days a week, there's no escape from it\".\nMr Healey said he doesn't think the changes will make any difference and wants changes to legislation in the UK - and abroad.\n\"With the laws in the UK, if someone is trolling you from outside the UK - and my last batch of trolls were from the US - the police said we can't do anything,\" he added.\nThe CPS says it will use \"considerable caution\" before charging those posting \"grossly offensive\" material.\nThe changes come after a report found that one in four teenagers is abused online over their sexual orientation, race, religion, gender or disability.\nThe CPS also said underage \"sexting\" between consenting children in a relationship should not be prosecuted, but cases which involve \"exploitation, grooming or bullying\" may lead to legal action.\nMs Saunders told the BBC: \"If they are children, they are the same age, there's no suggestion or any coercion or bad motives, then we would not expect that case to be prosecuted. It shows you how careful you have to be about the context of it,\" she said.\nAsked about whether guidelines on misogynistic hate crimes would be introduced, Ms Saunders said: \"We probably need to think about it.\"\nA new law on revenge porn - someone uploading explicit images or film of a former partner to humiliate or embarrass them - has led to the prosecution of 206 people across England and Wales since its introduction in April 2015.\nThe public policy statements on hate crime will be subject to public consultation for 13 weeks.",

    "The Public Health Wales study looks at adverse experiences in childhood (ACEs) which include parents separating.\nChildren with four or more ACEs, around 14%, are three times more likely to get lung or heart disease later in life.\nOne senior health figure said instead of \"mending broken adults\" a focus was needed on \"building stronger children\".\nThe findings are being published to coincide with a major international public health conference, hosted by PHW in Cardiff.\nIt is the last of three PHW studies looking at the first 1,000 days of life. More than 2,000 adults in Wales were interviewed.\nThe importance of giving children the best start in life has long been appreciated.\nBut this research looks at the long term impact of bad experiences in those crucial early years and how it could mean more chronic illness and more pressure on frontline services further down the line.\nThose having had four or more ACEs are also:\nProf Mark Bellis, director of policy and research at Public Health Wales said: \"Most of us have the odd shock in childhood and after that we relax and we're comforted by parents and our bodies develop at that lower, more relaxed level.\n\"But if you get constant exposure to adverse childhood experiences, your body develops at a higher state of tension, it's always looking out for more threats.\n\"That means as your body develops, it's used to being ready to be injured or hurt in some way and it wears out quicker.\n\"You're also more ill at ease, you may develop poorer metal health, you're more likely to use alcohol and drugs - and they increase your risks of ill health later on in life. All that adds up to you developing poor health, earlier.\"\nBut a child can experience adverse incidents even from within the womb.\nNSPCC midwife Nikki Rhys-Jones said: \"In the second trimester [the period from 13 to 27 weeks] of a woman's pregnancy, the baby can hear - so the baby will be aware of the sounds around her.\n\"So the baby can start relating and connecting to parents, however things like domestic abuse, violence in the household, shouting - a baby will experience that and those things will cause stress to a baby and impact on its development.\"\nEmerging research suggests the effects could also be passed on from one generation to the next.\nGenomic expert Dr Tom Connor, consultant for Public Health Wales and senior lecturer at Cardiff University, said: \"As individuals, we're almost a symphony of genes, firing off at different times.\n\"Epigenetics [which looks at changes in genes] actually controls expression of genes - and so things like smoking and drinking can actually affect the expression of genes, which can be passed on to our children.\n\"There's growing evidence that the lifestyle choices we make ourselves have an effect on our children. That's an immediate effect when they're born and potentially if we do things, for example smoking which can do damage to our children's DNA, that can be a long term effect for their entire lifetime.\"\nBut this is not just a challenge for the NHS.\nChildren who have had four or more adverse incidents are also 15 times more likely to be a perpetrator of violence, and 14 times more likely to be a victim.\nIf everyone shrinks into their core responsibilities, the cracks get bigger and more and more people fall down the cracks\nAlun Michael, South Wales Police and Crime Commissioner said the force was being made more aware of the impact of domestic incidents on children in the background - and it can only improve with all agencies working better together.\n\"There's tended to be an attempt to deal with those things by making referrals - pieces of paper passing from one organisation to another. You're never quite sure where they go,\" he said.\nBut a coordinated approach is not always easy to achieve, he argues, at a time when public spending is being squeezed.\n\"If everyone shrinks into their core responsibilities, the cracks get bigger and more and more people fall down the cracks and the consequences are more complex and dangerous further down the line,\" said Mr Michael.\n\"There's been a general feeling within Wales we must shrink together and not shrink apart. It's more important that we don't allow those gaps, that we don't let people fall down the cracks; we work together for a joined up approach.\"\nThe Welsh Government said the evidence on the negative impact of ACEs was \"overwhelming\" and it was  \"working relentlessly\" to prevent and reduce the long term impact on children who have experienced them.\nA spokesperson pointed to the Flying Start, Families First, and Supporting People programmes, as well as investing directly in children's health and well-being programmes.\nFor Prof Bellis it is crucial for the future to get it right.\n\"The long term costs of leaving these things untreated are enormous,\" he said. \"What we've got to focus on is instead of mending broken adults we must build stronger children.\"",

    "The introduction of the Fixed Term Parliaments Act, however, means that even if she wants to, Mrs May might not find it so easy.\nThe Act was introduced after the 2010 election to bind together the two parts of the new coalition government.\nThe discretion of prime ministers to pick the timing of elections was removed and the dates fixed five years apart - we are next due one on Thursday 7 May 2020.\nThe Act provides two mechanisms by which an early election could be triggered, which are:\nTaking each in turn, the government does not have the numbers on its own to achieve a two-thirds majority so any vote would depend on what the other parties do.\nJeremy Corbyn has warned the Labour Party to prepare for an election next year and Newsnight reported in September that he planned to instruct his MPs to vote in favour of an early election if the government wanted to call one (although that has not been confirmed). Latest polls suggest that supporting an early election would be a mistake for Labour.\nIt is unlikely the Scottish National Party would come to the government's assistance in bringing about an early election.\nLooking at the second mechanism, if other parties do not support an early election it would be unprecedented in British politics for a government to bring about its own downfall (though such engineering is not unknown elsewhere) and the government voting no confidence in itself could be a risky strategy.\nMore likely is that the Fixed Term Parliaments Act could be repealed or amended, to require, for example, a simple majority of MPs in favour of an early election, though the House of Lords may have something to say about this.\nAn amendment to existing legislation seems more straightforward than trying to reintroduce the prerogative power to call elections.\nIn short, the calling of an early election would require either a change in the law, or some unusual parliamentary gymnastics.",

    "About 47% of working South Africans earn less than the wage, which is being introduced to combat income poverty and inequality.\nBut critics say it could put more people out of work as employers might not be able to afford the higher wages.\nThe government says it will consult on the issue, but hopes to introduce a minimum wage within two years.\nAnnouncing the rate, which was proposed by a panel of advisers, the country's deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa said: \"We are now a step closer to finalising discussions on the national minimum wage. All social partners will now decide what their take is.\"\nHe said the panel was not endorsing the proposed figure as a living wage, but wanted to set a minimum payment for workers.\nWages are politically sensitive in the country, where the official unemployment rate is close to 25%.\nOne employment expert reckoned the figure was only about a quarter of the amount needed for the upkeep of a typical South African working-class household.\nProf Chris Malikane of the University of Witwatersrand told a Johannesburg radio station: \"You would need 12,000 rand to sustain a basic household.\"\nThe African National Congress, South Africa's ruling party, supported the proposal calling it \"credible and clearly supported by clear evidence\".\nHowever, the Economic Freedom Fighters, the country's third largest political party, said the plan \"favours business at the expense of workers\".\nIt called for a higher minimum wage of at least 4,500 rand.\nSouth Africa faces a possible downgrade to sub-investment grade by credit ratings agencies next month, with concerns remaining over violent wage strikes.\nMoody's currently rates South Africa two notches above subinvestment grade, with a negative outlook, while Fitch and S&P Global Ratings have it just a step above \"junk\".\nHowever, Mr Ramaphosa said: \"We have made tremendous progress on the labour instability issues,\"",

    "School crossing patrol personnel numbers have dropped by about 75 since 2013, leading to fears about safety.\nOverall, councils spent \u00a3810,000 less on the service than three years ago.\nStirling Council has reduced its outlay by the highest percentage, spending 50% less than in 2013.\nWest Dunbartonshire cut its spending on patrol services by 40%.\nThe figures were obtained from Freedom of Information requests answered by 30 of Scotland's 32 local authorities.\nIt showed there are now just over 2,100 school patrol officers in Scotland.\nDespite the widespread reductions, some local authorities actually increased their spend - including Inverclyde, where it went up by more than 90% and Dumfries and Galloway, where it increased by nearly 10%.\nA spokesman for Stirling Council, which had the biggest cut to school patrol services, said the decision was made three years ago following substantial cuts to its overall budget.\nHe added: \"The majority of these savings were made by removing lunch-time crossing patrols and removing any patrols which duplicated existing crossing safety measures (i.e. pelican and zebra crossings nearby). The safety of our pupils is of the utmost importance and we strive to maintain key crossing patrol services where these are required.\"\nWest Dunbartonshire said that patroller sites had been reduced due to a variety of factors including the relocation of schools, lack of use of sites and alternative facilities nearby.\nA spokesman for the council said: \"Over the last three years a number of our school crossing patrollers have retired or moved on to other roles.\n\"On review, some of the sites have no longer met the criteria for a crossing patroller and in other cases we have installed a pedestrian crossing.\n\"Increasing numbers of pupils remaining in school over lunchtime has also meant that there is no longer demand for cover during these times.\"\nThe Scottish Parent Teacher Council emphasised the importance of school patrollers for pupil safety.\nEileen Prior from the organisation said: \"Parents want to make sure that when they say goodbye to their child in the morning they can be confident they are going to be able to get to school safely.\n\"The reality on the ground is that services and supports for education services are being cut at local authority level. Lollipop people provide an important service that parents really value.\"\nFigures also show that over the period between 2013-16, the number of children killed on the roads fell, although the number seriously injured increased slightly.\nThe highest numbers of children were injured while walking during school drop-off and pick-up times.\nIn 2013 there were five children killed while on foot and 92 seriously injured - compared to three children killed last year and 97 seriously injured.\nHowever, according to Sustrans - which promotes safe walking and cycling networks across the UK - the number of children walking to school has fallen dramatically.\nIn its 2015 policy studies institute report, it cited figures from 1971, which showed 86% of children travelled home from school alone. That compared with figures from 2010 that showed only 25% walked to school.\nIn Scotland child pedestrians are two-and-a-half times more likely than adults to be injured in road traffic accidents.\nAlthough accident rates are falling, more child and adult pedestrians are injured in road traffic accidents in deprived areas compared with more affluent areas.\nOver the past decade, in deprived areas, three times as many child pedestrians were injured than in less deprived areas.\nA spokesman for Cosla, the umbrella group that represents many of Scotland's councils, said the issue of cuts to school crossing patrollers was related to the overall drop in council funding from the Scottish government.\nHe said: \"People all over Scotland are becoming more and more aware of the impact of cuts to council budgets.\n\"Each council will do everything in their power to restrict the impact of budget cuts on families and communities, but the nature of our work means that these cuts impact on everyone eventually.\n\"We continue to advocate for a fair settlement for local government in Scotland and look forward to negotiations with Scottish government on this matter.\"\nA Scottish government spokeswoman said: \"Spending on school patrollers is a matter for individual councils but the Scottish government has treated local government very fairly despite the cuts to the Scottish budget from the UK government.\n\"Taking into account the addition of the \u00a3250m to support the integration of health and social care, the overall reduction in 2016-17 funding equates to less than 1% of local government's total estimated expenditure in 2016-17.\"",
    "The report found that although alcohol consumption has dropped since 2008, those in poorer communities are more likely to suffer or die from alcohol-related disease.\nThe coalition government rejected a minimum price for alcohol in 2013.\nHealth ministers said they would look at the evidence carefully.\nThe public health review says that alcohol is now more affordable and people are drinking more than they did 40 years ago, making it the leading risk factor for ill health, early death and disability in those aged 15 to 49 in England.\nMore adults are non-drinkers but there are still more than 10 million people in England drinking at levels that could damage their health.\nThe report suggests there were 167,000 years of working life lost to alcohol in 2015 - mainly among the young and middle-aged.\nIt concludes that reducing the affordability of alcohol is the most cost-effective way of reducing alcohol harm.\nBut a plan to introduce a minimum price of 45p per unit of alcohol was shelved by the coalition government three years ago.\nIn 2014, a ban on the sale of alcohol below cost price, defined as alcohol duty plus VAT, came into force in England and Wales.\nPublic Health England (PHE) says implementing a minimum unit price (Mup) is the answer because it \"is a highly targeted measure which ensures tax increases are passed on to the consumer and improves the health of the heaviest drinkers\".\nIt also adds that combing Mup with an increase in taxation would lead to \"substantial reductions in harm and increases in government revenue\".\nThe report also says there is little evidence to suggest that putting more information on labels on alcoholic drinks would lead to a reduction in alcohol-related harm.\nA spokesman for the Department of Health said: \"While no one would want to interfere with the right of adults to enjoy a drink responsibly, this report shows clearly that the abuse of alcohol can cause significant health problems.\"\nAnd it added that new official guidance on alcohol limits, which say that men and women should drink no more than 14 units of alcohol a week, allowed people to make informed choices.\nProf Kevin Fenton, national director of health and wellbeing at PHE, said alcohol damaged more than just individuals.\n\"Excessive alcohol consumption can harm children, wreck families, impact on workplace colleagues and can be a burden and drain on the NHS and economy.\n\"This evidence review will help local and national government and public services like the police and NHS to develop policies designed to reduce the harmful effects of alcohol.\"\nShirley Cramer, chief executive of the Royal Society for Public Health, said she was hopeful that the evidence would be taken on board by government.\n\"The health harms of alcohol affect all sectors of society, but are felt most by the poorest and most vulnerable.\n\"All the evidence now points to Mup as one of the most effective potential ways to tackle these inequalities in harm.\"\nIn Scotland, laws for the minimum pricing for alcohol were passed in 2012 but have not yet been introduced because of a series of legal challenges.\nThe Welsh Government has said it wants to set a minimum 50p charge per unit of drink but UK ministers say alcohol law should be controlled by Westminster.",

    "A toxic mix of higher inflation, stagnant wage growth and falling consumer confidence means that 2017 and 2018 could see that economy in dark and chilly waters, and not working for many people.\nThe government will be expected to be ready with the lifeboats.\nLifeboats which many believe are on the small side and possibly full of holes.\nBritain still has considerable debts, is running a deficit and has a productivity problem - meaning the economy is not producing sufficient economic wealth to increase general incomes.\nSo far, the UK economy has performed robustly in the face of dire warnings that a vote to leave the European Union would lead to an immediate and negative impact on economic performance.\nConsumers have ignored the Cassandras standing at the shore, warning of shark-infested seas ahead, and have gone swimming anyway.\nToday saw the first evidence that one of those sharks - inflation - is starting to nibble at the bathers' toes.\nInflation's rise to its highest level for two years can be directly linked to the value of sterling, which has fallen by 16% this year, mainly following the referendum.\nAs the pound falls in value, import costs of staples like food and fuel rise.\nThat starts feeding through to prices that consumers pay.\nOf course, inflation is still at historically low levels - and no one is predicting a 1970s-style spike.\nMeanwhile, a weaker pound encourages exports as it is cheaper to sell British products abroad.\nBut many are arguing that where clothing and fuel prices go today - up compared to a year ago - food is likely to follow, cutting into people's already stretched finances.\nFor the moment, supermarkets and their suppliers (remember the Marmite row?) are soaking up the larger part of higher import costs by reducing their profit margins.\nThe cut-throat food market means that the run-up to Christmas - retailers' most important time - is not a time for widespread price increases.\nSome argue that this caution will not last much into the New Year.\nIf inflation does maintain its upward trajectory, then the Bank of England will need to consider the path interest rates might take.\nHigher inflation is usually controlled by higher interest rates, but that reduces business and consumer spending power because the cost of borrowing money increases.\nLess spending in the economy tends to be deflationary.\nSo if rates do rise, then that adds to the \"cost of living\" debate.\nA debate the prime minister knows will dominate her time in Downing Street.",
    "The central bank voted unanimously to raise the key rate to a range of 0.5% to 0.75%, citing a stronger economic growth and rising employment.\nBut the central bank said it expected the economy to need only \"gradual\" increases in the short term.\nFed chairwoman Janet Yellen said the economic outlook was \"highly uncertain\" and the rise was only a \"modest shift\".\nHowever, the new Donald Trump administration could mean rates having to rise at a faster pace next year, she signalled at a news conference after the announcement.\nThe president-elect has promised policies to boost growth through tax cuts, spending and deregulation.\nA US rate rise - how am I affected?\nUS rate rise: Should Asia worry?\nMs Yellen said it was wrong to speculate on Mr Trump's economic strategy without more details.\nBut she added that some members of the Federal Open Markets Committee, the body which sets rates, have factored in to their forecasts an increase in spending.\nAs a consequence, the FOMC said it now expects three rate rises next year rather than the two that were predicted in September.\nMs Yellen told the news conference: \"We are operating under a cloud of uncertainty... All the FOMC participants recognise that there is considerable uncertainty about how economic policy may change and what effect they may have on the economy.\"\nAlso, she declined to be drawn on Mr Trump's public comments about the Fed, and his use of tweets to announce policy and criticise companies.\n\"I'm a strong believer in the independence of the Fed,\" she told journalists. \"I am not going to offer the incoming president advice.\"\nThe interest rate move had been widely expected, and followed the last increase a year ago.\nRates have been near zero since the global financial crisis. But the US economy is recovering, underlined by recent data on consumer confidence, jobs, house prices and growth in manufacturing and services.\nMs Yellen said the rate rise \"should certainly be understood as a reflection of the confidence we have in the progress that the economy has made and our judgment that that progress will continue\".\nAlthough inflation is still below the Fed's 2% target, it expects the rise in prices to pick up gradually over the medium term.\n\"The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate,\" the Fed statement said.\nIt added: \"The federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.\"\nThe Fed also published its economic forecasts for the next three years.\nThese suggest that the Federal Funds rate may rise to 1.4% next year; 2.1% in 2018; and 2.9% in 2019.\nGDP growth will rise to 2.1% next year and stay there, more or less, during those years.\nThe unemployment rate will fall to 4.5% over the 2017-2019 period, the Fed forecast.\nAnd inflation will rise to 1.9% next year and hover at that level for the next two years.\nThe dollar rose 0.5% against the euro to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac0.9455, and was 0.9% higher against the yen at 116.17 yen.\nWall Street's main stock markets were largely unmoved immediately after the Fed's announcement, but drifted lower later. The Dows Jones index closed down 0.6%, and the S&P 500 was 0.8% lower.\nThere's a name missing from the Federal Reserve's statement - Donald Trump. The president-elect's surprise triumph at the polls last month has turned out to be a short term boost to the US economy.\nStock markets have surged higher, and consumer confidence indicators show US consumers feeling even more upbeat. The challenge for the Fed is working out what his election may mean to the economy in the next year or so.\nThe most obvious likely impact could come from tax cuts which both he and the Republican Congress seem to favour. Less certain is an infrastructure spending spree that Mr Trump would evidently like, but which many in Congress are less keen on.\nIf Janet Yellen and her colleagues considered these political issues, they weren't mentioned in the official statement on monetary policy. Nevertheless Mr Trump has a way of breaking in to most conversations these days.\nAnd the first question asked of Ms Yellen at her press conference duly concerned America's next president - and she admitted that Mr Trump's impact on US tax and spending policies might have influenced some of her colleagues forecasts for next year.",

    "Ronan Toolis led the excavation works at Trusty's Hill Fort at Gatehouse of Fleet.\nIt unearthed evidence that it might have been the royal seat of the sixth century kingdom of Rheged.\nMr Toolis said it was \"pre-eminent among the kingdoms of the north\" at that time.\nThe location of Rheged had previously been thought by many historians to be in Cumbria.\nHowever, Dr Christopher Bowles, co-director of the excavation work in Dumfries and Galloway, said that may not have been the case.\n\"The new archaeological evidence from Trusty's Hill enhances our perception of power, politics, economy and culture at a time when the foundations for the kingdoms of Scotland, England and Wales were being laid,\" he said.\n\"The 2012 excavations show that Trusty's Hill was likely the royal seat of Rheged, a kingdom that had Galloway as its heartland.\n\"This was a place of religious, cultural and political innovation whose contribution to culture in Scotland has perhaps not been given due recognition.\"\nDr Bowles said the influence of the kingdom had \"rippled through the history and literature of Scotland and beyond\".\nMr Toolis added that they had not been looking for Rheged when they started the excavations.\n\"What drew us to Trusty's Hill were Pictish symbols carved on to bedrock here, which are unique in this region and far to the south of where Pictish carvings are normally found,\" said Mr Toolis.\n\"The Galloway Picts Project was launched in 2012 to recover evidence for the archaeological context of these carvings.\n\"But far from validating the existence of Galloway Picts, the archaeological context revealed by our excavation instead indicates the carvings relate to a royal stronghold and place of inauguration for the local Britons of Galloway around AD 600.\n\"The new archaeological evidence suggests that Galloway may have been the heart of the lost Dark Age kingdom of Rheged, a kingdom that was in the late sixth century pre-eminent amongst the kingdoms of the north.\"\nThe two men have produced a new book which details their findings.\nThe Lost Dark Age Kingdom of Rheged is being launched in Gatehouse of Fleet on Saturday.",

    "If confirmed by the Senate, the 49-year-old would restore the court's conservative majority, lost with the death of Justice Antonin Scalia.\nThe Senate Democratic leader has said he has \"very serious doubts\" about Judge Gorsuch's nomination.\nThe court has the final legal word on many of the most sensitive US issues, from abortion to gender to gun control.\nMr Trump said Judge Gorsuch had a \"superb intellect, an unparalleled legal education, and a commitment to interpreting the Constitution according to text\".\n\"Judge Gorsuch has outstanding legal skills, a brilliant mind, tremendous discipline, and has earned bipartisan support,\" Mr Trump said.\nHe was picked from a shortlist of 21 choices, which Mr Trump made public during the election campaign.\nAccepting the nomination, he said: \"\"It is the role of judges to apply, not alter, the work of the people's representatives. A judge who likes every outcome he reaches is very likely a bad judge, stretching for results he prefers rather than those the law demands.\"\nJudge Gorsuch is a so-called originalist, meaning he believes the US Constitution should be followed as the Founding Fathers intended.\nIf successful, his nomination will restore the 5-4 conservative majority on the nine-seat high court.\nProtests against Mr Trump's choice were held outside the Supreme Court following the announcement.\nAbortion: He has not spoken out about Roe v Wade, the case which legalised abortion nationwide in 1973, making in difficult to pin down where he stands on the issue.\nBirth control: Judge Gorsuch has supported religious institutions which objected to requirements for employers to provide access to contraception. In one of his most high-profile cases, he defended the religious owners of retailer Hobby Lobby who refused to fund birth control via staff health insurance.\nGun rights: He hasn't ruled directly on firearms restrictions, but is thought to be generally pro-second amendment. He once wrote in a legal opinion that a citizen's right to bear arms \"must not be infringed lightly\".\nEuthanasia: He has been vocal about assisted dying, writing a book in 2009 which opposed legalisation.\nA conservative's dream: Anthony Zurcher, North America Reporter\nDonald Trump's choice of Neil Gorsuch as his Supreme Court nominee is a fairly traditional pick in a decidedly untraditional time.\nJudge Gorsuch has a CV and background that would make him a natural selection for just about any Republican president.\nHe's the kind of Supreme Court nominee evangelical and traditional conservative voters dreamed of as a reward for sticking with Mr Trump through the general election despite campaign missteps, controversies and occasional political apostasies.\nThey knew they would get a court pick they wouldn't like if Hillary Clinton won. They hoped they would get someone like Judge Gorsuch if Mr Trump prevailed.\nMeanwhile, Democrats are left fuming over Senate Republicans' precedent-breaking decision to stymie Barack Obama's attempts to fill this court vacancy for nearly 10 months.\nThey have to decide if they will try to derail Mr Gorsuch's nomination as retribution - perhaps forcing Republicans to break with another Senate tradition, the ability of a minority to a block a Supreme Court nominee with only 41 votes through a filibuster.\nThe party's base, feeling a liberal majority on the court was stolen from them, will demand lockstep resistance, likely setting up a divisive confirmation fight ahead.\nJudge Gorsuch's nomination is expected to spark a political showdown in the Senate.\nFormer President Barack Obama had put forward Judge Merrick Garland after Justice Scalia's death last February.\nBut Republicans refused to debate the choice, saying it was too close to an election, which left Democrats embittered.\nEven if Judge Gorsuch makes it through the Senate Judiciary Committee, he will still face challenges when the entire chamber convenes for a final vote.\nDemocrats may seek to prevent that second vote by prolonging or filibustering the debate. In that case, the nomination would need 60 votes rather than a simple majority.\nWith Republicans only holding 52 Senate seats, they may have to change Senate rules in order to approve Mr Trump's nominee.\nThe highest court in the US is often the ultimate arbiter on highly contentious laws, disputes between states and the federal government, and final appeals to stay executions.\nIt hears fewer than 100 cases a year and the key announcements are made in June.\nEach of the nine justices serves a lifetime appointment after being nominated by the president and approved by the Senate.\nThe court already has cases this term on the rights of transgender students, gerrymandered voting districts and on the Texas death penalty determination.\nIt is also likely the court will hear cases on voter rights, abortion, racial bias in policing and US immigration policy, and possibly on Mr Trump's controversial executive order banning refugees.",

    "The sanctions focus upon suppliers to Iran's missile programme and groups that help to arm what Washington sees as terror organisations in the region.\nIt is hard to see what practical impact these sanctions will have, since few of these organisations or individuals probably do business in the United States.\nBut the sanctions sends a clear warning to Tehran the guard has changed in Washington.\nThe Obama administration saw its relationship with Iran largely through the prism of the need to negotiate a deal to constrain Tehran's nuclear programme.\nIran's regional activities - support for Hamas and Hezbollah, military support for the Assad regime, backing of the Houthis in Yemen, and its growing influence in Iraq  - were all played down to ensure that the nuclear deal might go ahead.\nFor the Obama team, restraining Iran's nuclear activities was the overarching goal.\nThis was seen as an end in itself, one that might stave off military action, but also a step that might, over time, also lead Iran away from its relative economic isolation towards an improved relationship with the West.\nOpinion was deeply divided on the nuclear deal.\nThe US and its major western allies, along with Russia, saw merit in the nuclear agreement that effectively \"kicked the can down the road\", postponing any confrontation with Tehran over its nuclear programme.\nWashington's regional allies though - countries like Israel, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states, who have watched Tehran's rise with alarm - were much less impressed.\nAnd many of them may well have been hoping that the Trump team - which includes several vocal opponents of Tehran - might seek to undo the agreement.\nThings are a little more complex than that. On a recent trip to Israel's major annual security conference last week, many experts and officials there took the view that a bad deal, if properly implemented, might be better than no deal at all.\nWhat worries Israelis is the fact that Iran is now becoming a major player in the region.\nIts support for the Assad regime in Syria and the deployment of its allies - Hezbollah and various Shia militias, supported by officers from its Revolutionary Guard Corps - has provided Tehran with at least the opportunity to establish its allies on a long border with Israel from the Mediterranean Sea through Lebanon and Syria - all the way to the Jordanian frontier.\nJordan too is concerned, as are several of the Gulf states, which explains their quiet strategic rapprochement with Israel.\nThe irony in all of this is that it was largely US military power that established the conditions for Iran's rise to regional prominence.\nBy deposing its archenemy Saddam Hussein and reducing Iraq to a minor military player with many other security problems on its plate - Washington opened the door to the expansion of Iranian influence in the region.\nA further irony is that in supporting the Iraqi government's efforts against so-called Islamic State, the US is objectively allied with Tehran, with several Iranian-influenced Shia militias fighting in the same campaign.\nThe Obama administration's failure to countenance the forced removal of Syria's President Assad and its inept and half-hearted efforts to arm and train Sunni forces there, again favoured the emerging Shia axis.\nSo the Trump administration comes to office with a desire fundamentally to change Washington's stance towards Tehran. These sanctions are but the first step.\nA declaration that Iran is now \"on notice\", in the words of National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, may sound good, but it doesn't amount to a policy.\nWhat real steps does the Trump team envisage?\nIs it ready to back - albeit reluctantly - the nuclear accord while monitoring stringently Iran's behaviour?\nWhat wider international support can the US gather for tougher action against Tehran's missile programme - which it insists it is entitled to pursue?\nOn the face of it here the US may have a point. UN Security council resolution 2231 calls on Iran not to undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering a nuclear weapon.\nA US National Security Council briefing earlier this week noted that ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering a payload of at least 500kg to a range of 300km are inherently able to deliver nuclear weapons.\n\"There should be no doubt,\" the briefing went on , \"that the United States is committed to holding Iran accountable for adhering to missile restrictions and accountable for behaviour in the region that we consider to be destabilising.\"\nBut what exactly does the Trump Administration mean by phrases like \"holding Iran to account\"?\nThese are two countries whose warships potentially come into close proximity in Gulf waters every day. Tensions could spark a major confrontation. Is Washington on a collision course with Tehran?\nIts rhetoric might suggest so. But it is President Trump's actions - and of course Iran's own responses - that will determine where things go from here.",
    "Steve Morgan said the planning system was the biggest barrier to new houses.\nThe suggestion that housebuilders were sitting on landbanks in order to maximise profits was \"completely incorrect\", he told Radio 4's Today.\nMr Morgan was speaking after Redrow revealed strong half-year results.\nThe company reported that completed house sales were up 13% in the six months to December 2016 to 2,459 compared with the same period last year and pre-tax profits were up 35% to \u00a3140m.\nRedrow and other big builders have enjoyed big growth in profits for the last three years, but Mr Morgan said the industry was rebuilding its profitability after suffering heavy losses in the financial crisis. \"Profits are growing, but this is a return to normal levels from a nil start,\" he said.\nThe planning problem stemmed from difficulties in moving from outline permission - where a council says land is OK for housing - to detailed permission, when the builder can start work.\n\"This can take normally one year, but up to two years,\" Mr Morgan said. Redrow has just short of 26,000 plots in its landbank. \"At one-third of them, we just can't get on site.\"\nThe planning process was also inhibiting supply by dissuading smaller builders from doing more.\n\"It's not so bad for the big builders like us, but small companies face a wall of bureaucracy. If I was starting out today, I could not build up Redrow as I did.\"\nThe housing White Paper proposed forcing housebuilders to surrender land if construction had not started two years after planning permission was granted. The current rule is three years.\nMr Morgan said that if the time was counted from the grant of outline permission, it would make many projects \"impossible\".\nHe said references in the White Paper to a \"broken\" market were \"a bit disappointing\" and added: \"Actually, a lot has been done to increase output in the last few years, but of course, there is more to be done.\"",

I am hopeful that we will get some answers.\"\nMr Agnew said that the families of those murdered had been informed of the decision and the reasons for it, and that the PPS had offered to meet them \"to answer any further questions that they may have\".\n\"We are also conscious that inquest proceedings are currently adjourned to allow for any criminal matters to be concluded and accordingly have advised the coroner of this decision,\" he added.",

    "Restoring the function of the organ - which helps control blood sugar levels - reversed symptoms of diabetes in animal experiments.\nThe study, published in the journal Cell, says the diet reboots the body.\nExperts said the findings were \"potentially very exciting\" as they could become a new treatment for the disease.\nThe experiments were on mice put on a modified form of the \"fasting-mimicking diet\".\nWhen people go on it they spend five days on a low calorie, low protein, low carbohydrate but high unsaturated-fat diet.\nIt resembles a vegan diet with nuts and soups, but with around 800 to 1,100 calories a day.\nThen they have 25 days eating what they want - so overall it mimics periods of feast and famine.\nPrevious research has suggested it can slow the pace of ageing.\nBut animal experiments showed the diet regenerated a special type of cell in the pancreas called a beta cell.\nThese are the cells that detect sugar in the blood and release the hormone insulin if it gets too high.\nDr Valter Longo, from the University of Southern California, said: \"Our conclusion is that by pushing the mice into an extreme state and then bringing them back - by starving them and then feeding them again - the cells in the pancreas are triggered to use some kind of developmental reprogramming that rebuilds the part of the organ that's no longer functioning.\"\nThere were benefits in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes in the mouse experiments.\nType 1 is caused by the immune system destroying beta cells and type 2 is largely caused by lifestyle and the body no longer responding to insulin.\nFurther tests on tissue samples from people with type 1 diabetes produced similar effects.\nDr Longo said: \"Medically, these findings have the potential to be very important because we've shown - at least in mouse models - that you can use diet to reverse the symptoms of diabetes.\n\"Scientifically, the findings are perhaps even more important because we've shown that you can use diet to reprogram cells without having to make any genetic alterations.\"\nBBC reporter Peter Bowes took part in a separate trial with Dr Valter Longo.\nHe said: \"During each five-day fasting cycle, when I ate about a quarter of the average person's diet, I lost between 2kg and 4kg (4.4-8.8lbs).\n\"But before the next cycle came round, 25 days of eating normally had returned me almost to my original weight.\n\"But not all consequences of the diet faded so quickly.\"\nHis blood pressure was lower as was a hormone called IGF-1, which is linked to some cancers.\nHe said: \"The very small meals I was given during the five-day fast were far from gourmet cooking, but I was glad to have something to eat\"\nPeter Bowes: Fasting for science\nPeter Bowes: Intermittent fasting and the good things it did to my body\nSeparate trials of the diet in people have been shown to improve blood sugar levels. The latest findings help to explain why.\nHowever, Dr Longo said people should not rush off and crash diet.\nHe told the BBC: \"It boils down to do not try this at home, this is so much more sophisticated than people realise.\"\nHe said people could \"get into trouble\" with their health if it was done without medical guidance.\nDr Emily Burns, research communications manager at Diabetes UK, said: \"This is potentially very exciting news, but we need to see if the results hold true in humans before we'll know more about what it means for people with diabetes.\n\"People with type-1 and type-2 diabetes would benefit immensely from treatments that can repair or regenerate insulin-producing cells in the pancreas.\"\nFollow James on Twitter.",

    "He told Fox News: \"I think President Obama's behind it because his people are certainly behind it\", but added: \"I also think it's just politics.\"\nMr Trump offered no evidence for his claims and his predecessor in the White House has not commented.\nThe president also spoke about his budget plans and other issues.\nPresident Trump's interview was broadcast hours before he is due to give his first address to a joint session of Congress.\nA senior White House official told the BBC the president would talk about a \"renewal of the American spirit\", offering an \"optimistic vision\".\nIn the speech he is expected to set out in greater detail his plans to cut spending and boost the economy.\nMr Trump has said his proposal to increase the defence budget by $54bn (\u00c2\u00a343bn) would be paid for by a \"revved up economy\".\nThe foreign aid purse and the environmental department face a squeeze to pay for it, but analysts are doubtful the spending promises can be kept without increasing the deficit.\nThe president said he would get \"more product for our buck\" in terms of buying military hardware and would ask for a \"form of reimbursement\" from countries making use of the US military.\nIn other developments:\nIn the Fox News interview, Mr Trump was asked about the protests faced by some Republican politicians at town hall meetings across the country.\nHe said he was certain Obama loyalists were behind both those protests and White House leaks.\n\"In terms of him being behind things, that's politics. And it will probably continue,\" he added.\nHe was asked for more detail on how he would find the money for the 10% increase in military spending he has proposed for 2018. Proposed cuts elsewhere are unlikely to cover the proposed increase.\nAn address to Congress is a different kind of presidential speech. Will the American public see a different Donald Trump?\nIf history is any guide, that seems unlikely. Every time there has been talk of a pivot or shift of focus for candidate Trump, or president-elect Trump, or President Trump, the end result has been the same Donald Trump as always - blustering and belligerent, unvarnished and unapologetic.\nMr Trump would be well-served to take a different tack tonight, however. While he's spent his first month in office in a blizzard of activity, issuing executive orders and squelching controversies, there's been little progress with his agenda in Congress.\nTop-line items like tax cuts and healthcare reform will be heavy legislative lifts with a balky conservative caucus in the House and a narrow Republican majority in the Senate, requiring presidential leadership of a kind not yet demonstrated by Mr Trump.\nRecent opinion polls have shown the president's standing with the public improving after a dismal first few weeks, but any progress can quickly evaporate if his \"man of action\" bravado runs headfirst into congressional obstinance.\nTuesday night's speech is the president's first major opportunity to avoid that outcome.\nThe White House sent Mr Trump's 2018 budget blueprint, which begins on 1 October, to federal agencies on Monday.\nThe agencies will then review the plan and propose changes to the cuts as the White House prepares for negotiations with Congress.\nThe Republican-controlled Congress must approve any federal spending.\nMr Trump's plan is expected to face a backlash from Democrats and some Republicans over the planned cuts to domestic programmes.",
    "That's the verdict of scientists who have analysed ancient DNA of the extinct animals for mutations.\nThe studies suggest the last mammoths died out after their DNA became riddled with errors.\nThe knowledge could inform conservation efforts for living animals.\nThere are fewer than 100 Asiatic cheetahs left in the wild, while the remaining mountain gorilla population is estimated at about 300. The numbers are similar to those of the last woolly mammoths living on Wrangel Island in the Arctic Ocean around 4,000 years ago.\nDr Rebekah Rogers of the University of California, Berkeley, who led the research, said the mammoths' genomes \"were falling apart right before they went extinct\".\nThis, she said, was the first case of \"genomic meltdown\" in a single species.\n\"You had this last refuge of mammoths after everything has gone extinct on the mainland,\" she added.\n\"The mathematical theories that have been developed said that they should accumulate bad mutations because natural selection should become very inefficient.\"\nThe researchers analysed genetic mutations found in the ancient DNA of a mammoth from 4,000 years ago. They used the DNA of a mammoth that lived about 45,000 years ago, when populations were much larger,  as a comparison.\nWoolly mammoths were once common in North America and Siberia. They were driven to extinction by environmental factors and possibly human hunting about 10,000 years ago. Small island populations clung on until about 4,000 years ago.\n\"There was this huge excess of what looked like bad mutations in the genome of the mammoth from this island,\" said Dr Rogers.\n\"We found these bad mutations were accumulating in the mammoth genome right before they went extinct.\"\nKnowledge of the last days of the mammoth could help modern species on the brink of extinction, such as the panda, mountain gorilla and Indian elephant. The lesson from the woolly mammoth is that once numbers drop below a certain level, the population's genetic health may be beyond saving. Genetic testing could be one way to assess whether levels of genetic diversity in a species are enough to give it a chance of survival. A better option is to stop numbers falling too low.\n\"When you have these small populations for an extended period of time they can go into genomic meltdown, just like what we saw in the mammoth,\" said Dr Rogers.\n\"So if you can prevent these organisms ever being threatened or endangered then that will do a lot more to help prevent this type of genomic meltdown compared to if you have a small population and then bring it back up to larger numbers because it will still bear those signatures of this genomic meltdown.\"\nScientists think the genetic mutations may have given the last woolly mammoths \"silky, shiny satin fur\". Mutations may have also led to a loss of olfactory receptors, responsible for the sense of smell, as well as substances in urine involved in social status and attracting a mate.\nLove Dalen is professor of evolutionary genetics at the Swedish Museum of Natural History and head of the team of scientists that originally published the DNA sequences of the mammoths.\nHe said they found \"many deletions, big chunks of the genome that are missing, some of which even affected functional genes\".\n\"This is a very novel result,\" he said. \"If this holds up when more mammoth genomes, as well as genomes from other species, are analysed, it will have very important implications for conservation biology.\"\nThe research is published in the journal, PLOS Genetics.\nFollow Helen on Twitter.",
    "It looks pretty likely that the cross-party amendment on giving Parliament a final vote on the Brexit deal will be pushed to a division.\nAnd so will the Lib Dem amendment to give people what they call \"a final say on the final deal\" and what others call a second referendum. Potentially there could be further votes on issues like the Brexit implications for Northern Ireland.\nThe expectation is that the amended bill will get its Third Reading on Tuesday evening....but the ritual of Parliamentary ping-pong, where the Bill then bounces between the Lords and Commons until its final form can be agreed, will have to be postponed for a while.\nThe opportunity for the Commons to accept or - more likely - reject the changes made by peers will be blocked by the debate on the Budget, which will occupy the Commons into the following week.\nSo there will be a week or more for the pressure to build on MPs before they vote on the issue - and during the interval the Commons Brexit Select Committee will publish a report on the rights of UK and EU citizens (on Sunday) in good time to influence the vote.\nIt's a sign of the times that Brexit could eclipse what's normally a highlight of the Parliamentary year, but there will be plenty to watch out for in what will be the last full-scale budget in March. Next year it will be downgraded to a mere \"Spring Statement\" with the Budget moving to the autumn.\nFirst up the forecasts for government debt, with the Treasury continuing to seek further austerity savings across government. Second, whether there will be an injection of extra funds to defuse the row over business rates, and third, whether the government will put more money into adult social care, and maybe even signal a long term review of the system.\nThe Westminster buzz is that the public finances are in better shape than expected - but that any spare cash will be stashed away in a Brexit war chest, rather than spent now.\nElsewhere, there's important action on the Children and Social Work Bill, where the government has delighted cross-party campaigners by bringing forward amendments to make relationship educations (emphatically not sex education) compulsory at primary school level.\nCross-party pressure from family values campaigners like the influential Conservative backbencher, David Burrowes, and supporters of extended sex education like the Women and Equalities Committee Chair, Maria Miller, and Labour's Sarah Champion, appears to have secured its goal.\nBoth groups were persuaded that a new approach was needed to tackle the problem of sexting and sexual harassment in schools.\nAnd the government may also be tested on a couple of issues on the Higher Education Bill, where there are two days of Report Stage consideration in the Lords.\nThe Commons opens at 14.30 BST with Home Office Questions - and then watch out for any ministerial statements or urgent questions at 3.30.\nIn particular, the Culture Secretary Karen Bradley is expected to update MPs on the proposed merger between Sky and 21st Century Fox, which has now been formally notified to the European Commission.\nAn earlier attempt at this was withdrawn during the 2010 Parliament, in the wake of the hacking scandal, and the issue remains highly sensitive.\nShe must decide by 17 March 17 whether to ask the regulator, Ofcom, to carry out a public interest test.\nThen MPs move on to the Second Reading debate of the Vehicle Technology and Aviation Bill - this aims, among other things, to create a legal framework for insuring automated vehicles, because at the moment the law does not provide for them, require fuel retailers to provide charge points for electric cars, and create a new criminal offence of shining a laser at any means of transport.\nThere's also a separate draft bill to create a UK spaceport, which will go out for pre-legislative scrutiny by the Commons Science and Technology Committee.\nIn Westminster Hall at 16.30 GMT MPs debate e-petition 129823 which says that dress code laws should be changed so that women have the option to wear flat formal shoes at work, if they wish, arguing that \"current formal work dress codes are out-dated and sexist\".\nIn the Lords at 14.30 GMT the usual half hour of questions to ministers is followed by the first Report Stage day on the Higher Education and Research Bill. Expect votes on tiered Higher Educational establishments - gold, silver, bronze universities.\nWatch out too for a short debate on recent legislation on assisted dying in North America; and whether those laws provide an appropriate basis for legislation in England and Wales, led by Labour's Baroness Jay of Paddington.\nThis suggests that the Lords assisted dying lobby have not entirely given up following the defeat of Rob Marris's bill in the Commons, last year.\nMPs begin at 11.30 GMT with Justice Questions, followed by a Ten Minute Rule Bill on the Queen's Sapphire Jubilee from the Conservative, Andrew Rosindell.\nThe day's main event is the Report stage of the Children and Social Work Bill (see above). The Conservative Sir Edward Leigh has fired in an amendment to the sex and relationship education proposals, to allow a parent to request that their child be wholly or partly excused.\nLabour MPs are also proposing new clauses to ensure that children in care are allowed reasonable contact with their siblings, and to revoke provisions in the Bill that enable local authorities in England and Wales to place children in secure accommodation in Scotland, and vice versa.\nThere are a battery of amendments on child safeguarding issues including a big cross-party amendment on requiring regular reports by local councils on their ability to provide proper safeguarding services for children.\nIn Westminster Hall, the debates are on: beer duty (9.30 GMT); the Coast to Coast Walk (11.00 GMT); the O'Neill review into antibiotic resistance (14.30 GMT); the sale of student loans (16.00 GMT) and social care in Liverpool (16.30 GMT).\nMy Committee pick is the Home Affairs session, with Rob Wainwright, the Director of Europol on policing and security issues across the EU and Britain's role, post-Brexit (14.15 GMT).\nThis is a key Brexit issue, and one where the Prime Minister has made clear her enthusiasm for continued British participation in Europol.\nIn the Lords, peers open for business at the earlier than usual time of 11.00 GMT to provide extra debating time for the Report Stage consideration of the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill  - breaking off, briefly, at 14.30 GMT for their usual half an hour of questions to ministers.\nAfter the Report Stage, three hours of Brexit breathing space is provided while the amended version of the Bill is knocked into shape. During this interval there will be a 90 minute debate on the economic and environmental benefits of shale gas development in the UK, led by the former trade minister Lord Truscott.\nAnd then there may be an adjournment for a while, before peers can return to the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill, for the Third Reading debate. This is normally a rather sonorous formality, but may not be on this occasion....\nThe Commons opens at 11.30 GMT with Welsh Questions followed by Prime Minister's Questions at noon. And then it's onto the Budget (see above).\nThe day's Westminster Hall debates are on: financial support for apprentices (9.30 GMT); compensation and the Pandemrix vaccine (11 GMT); the proposed ban on microbeads (14.30 GMT); extension of the right to buy to tenants of housing associations in Bedford (16.00 GMT) and broadband speeds (16.30 GMT).\nIn the Lords at 16.00 GMT it's the second Report Stage day on the Higher Education and Research Bill. There will also be a short debate on the UK's exports strategy.\nMPs open at 09.30 GMT with Exiting the European Union Questions, followed by the weekly Business Statement from the Leader of the House - before moving on to day two of the Budget debate.\nIn Westminster Hall, from 13.30 GMT, there's a debate on the Scottish Affairs Select Committee report on the Demography of Scotland and the implications for devolution.\nThis looks at the policy problems posed by the combination of Scotland's slower population growth, its ageing population and lower life expectancy, particularly for health and care services, potentially increasing the demands on NHS Scotland and Scottish social care services in the future.\nAt 15.00 GMT the subject is human rights and the political situation in Turkey.\nIn the Lords at 13.00 GMT, the main event is the Second Reading of the Criminal Finances Bill which aims to tackle money laundering, terrorist finance and corruption the UK and overseas, in the wake of the Panama papers revelations of industrial scale tax avoidance.\nThe National Crime Agency estimates that up to \u00c2\u00a390bn may be laundered in the UK each year. The Bill was criticised in the Commons for failing to include penalties for companies which permitted their staff to facilitate money laundering, or do more to reveal the beneficial owners of assets, or deal with the lack of corporate transparency in Britain's crown dependencies and overseas territories.\nThat is followed be a debate to mark International Women's Day.\nThe Lords meets at 10.00 GMT to debate the detail of a series of private members bills from the Commons. First up will be the Second Reading of the Preventing and Combating Violence Against Women and Domestic Violence Bill - which incorporates the Istanbul Convention into UK law.\nNext the Committee stage of the Homelessness Reduction Bill - which puts new obligations on local councils to help and advise people who have lost their homes or are in danger of doing so. Then there's the Committee stage of the completely uncontroversial Parking Places (Variation of Charges) Bill - which gives local authorities more flexibility over parking charges.\nAnd finally there's a Second Reading debate on the Political Parties (Funding and Expenditure) private members' Bill [HL] from the Lib Dem, Lord Tyler.\nJust as the Lib Dems overtook Labour in donations for the first time ever in the final quarter of 2016, his Bill would gradually take down the maximum amount a political party can accept from any one person in a year to \u00c2\u00a310,000 by 2026.",

Everyone deserves a chance at life and every child deserves a mum.\"\nShe added: \"To be told that you have cancer and your life is therefore limited because of that is devastating enough.\n\"But to then be told there is something that can potentially buy you some time or keep you well for longer, but you can't have it, seems to me barbaric.\"\nShe described living with an incurable cancer as like \"swallowing a hand-grenade and not knowing when it is going to go off\".\n\"This treatment offers a little glimmer of hope that it will buy us time and offers hope that in the meantime maybe someone can come up with something that will keep us here in addition to that,\" Ms Graham said.\nBreast Cancer Now said there were about 118 women in Scotland who \"could benefit from this drug if it was approved tomorrow\".\nThe charity's director Mary Allison said: \"The treatment options for this type of breast cancer are relatively limited. Kadcyla is an incredibly effective drug because of the impact it has on the cancer, but also because of the quality of life people are able to have. The side effects of this compared to other chemotherapies are far less.\n\"This drug is available in 18 other countries in the world. It is a commonly-administered drug and one that many oncologists throughout the UK, and in Scotland, would wish to give their patients.\n\"It is a proven, front-line treatment for HER2 positive breast cancer.\"\nIn September last year, NHS Grampian agreed to give Kadcyla to Anne MacLean-Chang, a nurse from Elgin, after she wrote to the first minister asking for reform of drug funding.\nShe fought breast cancer but it later spread to her liver.\nSpeaking to presenter Kaye Adams ahead of the latest meeting of the SMC, she said being told there was a drug available but that she could not have it made her determined to campaign and fundraise to ensure she got the treatment.\n\"I felt like a bear protecting her cubs because I need to be here for my children,\" she said.\n\"Anyone can get cancer or a life-threatening disease but I don't think, in 2017, I ever imagined I would be in the situation where there was a drug available in many parts of the world but I was being told it's out there but you can't have it.\"\nBBC health correspondent Nick Triggle wrote about the drug in 2014, spelling out how its high cost was causing a funding conundrum.",

    "An investigation into Pembrokeshire council's dealings with Michael Smith said it was \"only luck\" that stopped his application.\nThe 2015 review was confidential, but a copy of the report has been exclusively obtained by the Western Telegraph.\nIt revealed a head of service initially failed to provide information of child protection concerns about Smith.\nPembrokeshire council said \"it is unfortunate that a member of the authority has seen fit to disclose the report, contrary to advice\".\nSmith, from Haverfordwest, was employed as a youth worker for the council between May 2001 and January 2012.\nDuring that time he was the subject of three disciplinary hearings.\nAllegations against him included allowing a child to sit on his lap and drive his Land Rover, allowing a child to sit in his Land Rover without wearing a seatbelt, and a young person, who had been reported missing by their foster carer, had shown up at his home.\nThe report, which was compiled by an independent social worker, said Smith \"displayed many grooming behaviours during the years he was employed by Pembrokeshire council but there were no direct allegations of abuse during this time\".\nSmith was dismissed for gross misconduct and in September 2013 a police investigation began after he was accused of sexually abusing a boy.\nHe was jailed for six years in July 2014 after admitting sexually assaulting a child under the age of 13, inciting the child to engage in sexual activity and taking indecent photographs of the child.\nHe also admitted possessing 1,136 indecent images of children.\nThe report said in 2010 Smith had applied to Pembrokeshire council to become a respite foster carer.\nThe fostering team wrote to the Head of Youth Service for his views on Smith's application.\nThe report said the head of service had \"replied in very positive terms\".\nA formal reference form which the head of service was sent asked him to \"highlight any concerns\" regarding Smith's employment, including any disciplinary proceedings and the outcomes.\nThe head of service left the section blank.\nIt was not until the papers were distributed to the foster panel that one of the members recalled Smith had been investigated previously for inappropriate behaviour with children and had been disciplined.\nThe panel concluded Smith was not suitable for approval to be a foster carer.\n\"By withholding relevant information and leaving the section of the form blank, the foster panel might have concluded that there had been no concerns and no disciplinary action,\" the report said.\n\"It was only chance that a member of the fostering panel recollected the safeguarding investigation in 2005\" and \"only luck that prevented Smith from being approved as a foster carer\".\nThere have been calls to make the report public.\nThe latest request took place at full council on 2 March when Cllr Mike Stoddart had put forward a notice of motion asking for it to be published.\nHe said it is in \"the public interest to publish the report so that the electorate can be fully apprised of the chain of events surrounding this issue.\"\nHis motion was defeated by a single vote.\nA statement from Pembrokeshire council said: \"The report contains personal information in relation to children, parents and professionals, and the report was made available to members on this basis. Further publication of this report was restricted.\n\"On making the report available to all members, they were made aware that there are families in the area who remain affected by the actions of Mr Smith, and were reminded of their corporate obligation to safeguard everyone in the community.\"",

    "Mosimane said they could only blame themselves for not capitalising on a quick start in Atteridgeville, just outside Pretoria, where they were 2-0 up after just six minutes as their Ugandan visitors seemed to suffer from stage fright.\nWe have ourselves to blame for putting ourselves in this position so we need to take ourselves out of this position\nSundowns had the lion's share of possession in the first leg of their last 32-tie after that, but still allowed KCCA to get back into the game and net a potentially vital away goal in the 69th minute.\n\"We have ourselves to blame for putting ourselves in this position so we need to take ourselves out of this position. So we have to fight for it.

He said KCCA would be forced to leave gaps at the back as they went in search of victory in front of their own supporters\n\"It won't be an easy game for them either because they have to push everybody upfront to go score And then we can play on the break also because we've got that ability.\"\nKCCA surprised Mosimane with their work ethic and their recovery after conceding goals to centre backs Bangaly Soumahoro and Ricardo Nascimento so early in the game\n\"They worked hard. They are a hard working team, they really worked off the ball, they fight, they run, they don't give up, they have the hope,\" he said of the Ugandan champions, who are also current league leaders in their domestic competition.\nSundowns now face the possibility of joining the likes of recent champions who have come unstuck in embarrassingly early fashion in defence of their crown.\nLast year it was TP Mazembe who went out before the group phase and two years before that Egypt's Al Ahly were handed a shock second round defeat by their namesakes from Benghazi in Libya.",
    "The story of Akong Tulku Rinpoche was screened at the Samye Ling site he founded in Eskdalemuir.\nA Remarkable Life covers everything from his birth in Tibet in 1939 to his murder in China in 2013.\nShortly before his death, he authorised the film to be made which was given its premiere in southern Scotland.\nAkong Rinpoche was installed as abbot of a monastery in eastern Tibet at the age of just four having been identified as the reincarnation of the previous abbot.\nWhen he was 19, with China having occupied Tibet and tensions between the countries at their height, he joined a freedom walk over the Himalayas to India.\nIt took 10 months and of the 200 people who started, only 15 survived.\nAkong eventually made his way to the UK in 1959 and acquired an old farmhouse at Eskdalemuir where Samye Ling was founded in 1967.\nThe film's executive producer Vin Harris told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: \"I think they travelled around lots of places, there was a story that it kind of reminded them of Tibet.\n\"There was someone there who was running a spiritual centre and he was ready to move on so they basically took it over.\n\"They were very much welcomed, particularly in Dumfries, Rinpoche made his family life there and had very good friends here.\"\nSamye Ling was the first Buddhist monastery to be founded in Europe and students later included David Bowie and Leonard Cohen.\nIt has now grown into a large complex for the study and teaching of Buddhism, with a vast temple at its heart.\nFrom there, Akong spearheaded a range of projects including  ROKPA International, which carries out humanitarian work in Tibet, Nepal, India and Africa.\nIt was while in China in October 2013 that he was murdered, aged 73, but before his death he authorised the film of his life to be made.\nIts premiere at Samye Ling was attended by the current abbot, Akong's younger brother Lama Yeshe Losal Rinpoche.\n\"We feel that the film is more a message of hope actually - a celebration of his life,\" Mr Harris said.\n\"It kind of focuses on the fact that putting compassion into action, rather than being a kind of luxury, is so effective.\n\"We look at what, as a refugee, he achieved - setting up centres all over the world and helping thousands and thousands of people without compromising that value of compassion.\"",

    "Dear President Tusk\nOn 23 June last year, the people of the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union. As I have said before, that decision was no rejection of the values we share as fellow Europeans. Nor was it an attempt to do harm to the European Union or any of the remaining member states. On the contrary, the United Kingdom wants the European Union to succeed and prosper. Instead, the referendum was a vote to restore, as we see it, our national self-determination. We are leaving the European Union, but we are not leaving Europe - and we want to remain committed partners and allies to our friends across the continent.\nEarlier this month, the United Kingdom Parliament confirmed the result of the referendum by voting with clear and convincing majorities in both of its Houses for the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill. The Bill was passed by Parliament on 13 March and it received Royal Assent from Her Majesty The Queen and became an Act of Parliament on 16 March.\nToday, therefore, I am writing to give effect to the democratic decision of the people of the United Kingdom. I hereby notify the European Council in accordance with Article 50(2) of the Treaty on European Union of the United Kingdom's intention to withdraw from the European Union. In addition, in accordance with the same Article 50(2) as applied by Article 106a of the Treaty Establishing the European Atomic Energy Community, I hereby notify the European Council of the United Kingdom's intention to withdraw from the European Atomic Energy Community. References in this letter to the European Union should therefore be taken to include a reference to the European Atomic Energy Community.\nSee the letter as published by Downing Street (PDF)\nThis letter sets out the approach of Her Majesty's Government to the discussions we will have about the United Kingdom's departure from the European Union and about the deep and special partnership we hope to enjoy - as your closest friend and neighbour - with the European Union once we leave. We believe that these objectives are in the interests not only of the United Kingdom but of the European Union and the wider world too.\nIt is in the best interests of both the United Kingdom and the European Union that we should use the forthcoming process to deliver these objectives in a fair and orderly manner, and with as little disruption as possible on each side. We want to make sure that Europe remains strong and prosperous and is capable of projecting its values, leading in the world, and defending itself from security threats. We want the United Kingdom, through a new deep and special partnership with a strong European Union, to play its full part in achieving these goals. We therefore believe it is necessary to agree the terms of our future partnership alongside those of our withdrawal from the European Union.\nThe Government wants to approach our discussions with ambition, giving citizens and businesses in the United Kingdom and the European Union - and indeed from third countries around the world - as much certainty as possible, as early as possible.\nI would like to propose some principles that may help to shape our coming discussions, but before I do so, I should update you on the process we will be undertaking at home, in the United Kingdom.\nAs I have announced already, the Government will bring forward legislation that will repeal the Act of Parliament - the European Communities Act 1972 - that gives effect to EU law in our country. This legislation will, wherever practical and appropriate, in effect convert the body of existing European Union law (the \"acquis\") into UK law.  This means there will be certainty for UK citizens and for anybody from the European Union who does business in the United Kingdom. The Government will consult on how we design and implement this legislation, and we will publish a White Paper tomorrow. We also intend to bring forward several other pieces of legislation that address specific issues relating to our departure from the European Union, also with a view to ensuring continuity and certainty, in particular for businesses. We will of course continue to fulfil our responsibilities as a member state while we remain a member of the European Union, and the legislation we propose will not come into effect until we leave.\nFrom the start and throughout the discussions, we will negotiate as one United Kingdom, taking due account of the specific interests of every nation and region of the UK as we do so. When it comes to the return of powers back to the United Kingdom, we will consult fully on which powers should reside in Westminster and which should be devolved to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. But it is the expectation of the Government that the outcome of this process will be a significant increase in the decision-making power of each devolved administration.\nThe United Kingdom wants to agree with the European Union a deep and special partnership that takes in both economic and security cooperation. To achieve this, we believe it is necessary to agree the terms of our future partnership alongside those of our withdrawal from the EU.\nIf, however, we leave the European Union without an agreement the default position is that we would have to trade on World Trade Organisation terms. In security terms a failure to reach agreement would mean our cooperation in the fight against crime and terrorism would be weakened. In this kind of scenario, both the United Kingdom and the European Union would of course cope with the change, but it is not the outcome that either side should seek. We must therefore work hard to avoid that outcome.\nIt is for these reasons that we want to be able to agree a deep and special partnership, taking in both economic and security cooperation, but it is also because we want to play our part in making sure that Europe remains strong and prosperous and able to lead in the world, projecting its values and defending itself from security threats.  And we want the United Kingdom to play its full part in realising that vision for our continent.\nLooking ahead to the discussions which we will soon begin, I would like to suggest some principles that we might agree to help make sure that the process is as smooth and successful as possible.\ni. We should engage with one another constructively and respectfully, in a spirit of sincere cooperation. Since I became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom I have listened carefully to you, to my fellow EU Heads of Government and the Presidents of the European Commission and Parliament. That is why the United Kingdom does not seek membership of the single market: we understand and respect your position that the four freedoms of the single market are indivisible and there can be no \"cherry picking\". We also understand that there will be consequences for the UK of leaving the EU: we know that we will lose influence over the rules that affect the European economy. We also know that UK companies will, as they trade within the EU, have to align with rules agreed by institutions of which we are no longer a part - just as UK companies do in other overseas markets.\nii. We should always put our citizens first. There is obvious complexity in the discussions we are about to undertake, but we should remember that at the heart of our talks are the interests of all our citizens. There are, for example, many citizens of the remaining member states living in the United Kingdom, and UK citizens living elsewhere in the European Union, and we should aim to strike an early agreement about their rights.\niii. We should work towards securing a comprehensive agreement.  We want to agree a deep and special partnership between the UK and the EU, taking in both economic and security cooperation. We will need to discuss how we determine a fair settlement of the UK's rights and obligations as a departing member state, in accordance with the law and in the spirit of the United Kingdom's continuing partnership with the EU. But we believe it is necessary to agree the terms of our future partnership alongside those of our withdrawal from the EU.\niv. We should work together to minimise disruption and give as much certainty as possible. Investors, businesses and citizens in both the UK and across the remaining 27 member states - and those from third countries around the world - want to be able to plan. In order to avoid any cliff-edge as we move from our current relationship to our future partnership, people and businesses in both the UK and the EU would benefit from implementation periods to adjust in a smooth and orderly way to new arrangements. It would help both sides to minimise unnecessary disruption if we agree this principle early in the process.\nv. In particular, we must pay attention to the UK's unique relationship with the Republic of Ireland and the importance of the peace process in Northern Ireland. The Republic of Ireland is the only EU member state with a land border with the United Kingdom. We want to avoid a return to a hard border between our two countries, to be able to maintain the Common Travel Area between us, and to make sure that the UK's withdrawal from the EU does not harm the Republic of Ireland. We also have an important responsibility to make sure that nothing is done to jeopardise the peace process in Northern Ireland, and to continue to uphold the Belfast Agreement.\nvi. We should begin technical talks on detailed policy areas as soon as possible, but we should prioritise the biggest challenges. Agreeing a high-level approach to the issues arising from our withdrawal will of course be an early priority.  But we also propose a bold and ambitious Free Trade Agreement between the United Kingdom and the European Union. This should be of greater scope and ambition than any such agreement before it so that it covers sectors crucial to our linked economies such as financial services and network industries. This will require detailed technical talks, but as the UK is an existing EU member state, both sides have regulatory frameworks and standards that already match. We should therefore prioritise how we manage the evolution of our regulatory frameworks to maintain a fair and open trading environment, and how we resolve disputes.  On the scope of the partnership between us - on both economic and security matters - my officials will put forward detailed proposals for deep, broad and dynamic cooperation.\nvii. We should continue to work together to advance and protect our shared European values. Perhaps now more than ever, the world needs the liberal, democratic values of Europe.  We want to play our part to ensure that Europe remains strong and prosperous and able to lead in the world, projecting its values and defending itself from security threats.\nAs I have said, the Government of the United Kingdom wants to agree a deep and special partnership between the UK and the EU, taking in both economic and security cooperation.  At a time when the growth of global trade is slowing and there are signs that protectionist instincts are on the rise in many parts of the world, Europe has a responsibility to stand up for free trade in the interest of all our citizens. Likewise, Europe's security is more fragile today than at any time since the end of the Cold War. Weakening our cooperation for the prosperity and protection of our citizens would be a costly mistake. The United Kingdom's objectives for our future partnership remain those set out in my Lancaster House speech of 17 January and the subsequent White Paper published on 2 February.\nWe recognise that it will be a challenge to reach such a comprehensive agreement within the two-year period set out for withdrawal discussions in the Treaty. But we believe it is necessary to agree the terms of our future partnership alongside those of our withdrawal from the EU. We start from a unique position in these discussions - close regulatory alignment, trust in one another's institutions, and a spirit of cooperation stretching back decades. It is for these reasons, and because the future partnership between the UK and the EU is of such importance to both sides, that I am sure it can be agreed in the time period set out by the Treaty.\nThe task before us is momentous but it should not be beyond us. After all, the institutions and the leaders of the European Union have succeeded in bringing together a continent blighted by war into a union of peaceful nations, and supported the transition of dictatorships to democracy. Together, I know we are capable of reaching an agreement about the UK's rights and obligations as a departing member state, while establishing a deep and special partnership that contributes towards the prosperity, security and global power of our continent.\nYours sincerely\nTheresa May",

    "During a visit to Birmingham on Tuesday, Jeremy Corbyn is expected to say a 17% increase in Carer's Allowance would help around one million people in the first year of a Labour government.\nUnder the plan, Carer's Allowance would rise from \u00a362.70 to \u00a373.10 a week.\nMinisters say they will spend an extra \u00a32bn on social care over three years.\nCarer's Allowance is paid to around 6.5m people in the UK who care for older, disabled and seriously ill friends or relatives for at least 35 hours a week.\nEligible carers cannot earn more than \u00a3116 a week after tax.\nMr Corbyn said he believed it \"would be a good thing to do\" to help carers, \"usually women\" who have to give up their jobs to look after elderly relatives at home.\n\"Caring for people is stressful,\" he told the BBC. \"In some way it's enjoyable because you want to do it, but you shouldn't be impoverished because of it. It's also lonely.\"\nIn his speech later, the Labour leader will claim \"Britain's social care crisis was made in Downing Street by cutting \u00a34.6bn from council care budgets\".\n\"Millions of unpaid carers have been forced to fill the gap and put under even greater pressure as a result,\" he will say.\n\"The care they give to the disabled, sick and elderly saves taxpayers \u00a3132bn a year. So we believe these unsung, unpaid heroes not only deserve our praise and recognition - they deserve better financial support.\n\"That's why Labour is convinced it's both morally and economically right to give the Carer's Allowance a boost of \u00a310 a week.\n\"We also think it's only fair that this extra support for carers is funded by scrapping the Tory cut on inheritance tax, which will only benefit the wealthiest people in Britain.\n\"This will be the first step in helping to transform our social care system for the 21st century and boosting support for family carers.\"\nAccording to Labour, up-rating Carer's Allowance would cost \u00a3538m by 2020/21. This would be covered by scrapping the expected \u00a3650m cut to inheritance tax, which allows married couples to pass on estates worth \u00a31m free of death duties.\nBut the Conservatives claim Labour would be unable to fund the promise to increase the allowance.\nLuke Hall, a Tory member of the Commons work and pensions select committee, said: \"Carers make a huge contribution to society, so it's only right that we do everything we can to support the selfless work they do.\n\"That's why we already increased the rate of Carer's Allowance, meaning an additional \u00a3450 a year for carers since 2010.\n\"Labour have already committed the money from corporation tax cuts 11 times over, so there is no way they could find the additional money for this promise.\n\"It's not worth the paper it's written on - just like Labour's reputation for economic management.\"\nThe government has recently committed to spending an extra \u00a32bn on the social care system over the next three years and allowed local authorities to raise council tax bills in order to fund social care services.",

    "Media playback is not supported on this device\nThe credibility of records was examined following the sport's doping scandal.\nBritain's Paula Radcliffe, who faces losing her 2003 marathon world record, called the proposals \"cowardly\".\n\"I am hurt and do feel this damages my reputation and dignity,\" she said, adding that the governing bodies had \"again failed clean athletes\".\nSvein Arne Hansen, the European Athletics president, said world records \"are meaningless if people don't really believe them\".\nHowever, Radcliffe said the changes were \"heavy handed\" and \"confusing to the public\".\nEuropean Athletics set up a taskforce to look into the credibility of world records in January. Its ruling council has now ratified the proposals put forward by the taskforce, and it wants the sport's world governing body, the IAAF, to adopt the changes it sets out.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nIf the proposals are accepted by the IAAF, a world record would only be recognised if it meets all three of the following criteria:\nThe IAAF has stored blood and urine samples only since 2005 and current records that do not meet the new criteria would remain on an \"all-time list\", but not be officially recognised as records.\nThis would include Jonathan Edwards' triple jump record of 18.29m - set in 1995 - and Colin Jackson's 1994 indoor 60m hurdles world record of 7.30secs, as well as Radcliffe's marathon mark of two hours 15 minutes and 25 seconds, set in 2003 using two male pacemakers.\nMary Keitany of Kenya broke Radcliffe's women's-only world record to win the 2017 London Marathon in two hours 17 minutes one second, the second-fastest time in history.\nThe council also recommended that a performance should be wiped from record books if the athlete had committed a \"doping or integrity violation, even if it does not directly impact the record performance\".\nThe proposals are a response to last year's McLaren report, which uncovered widespread doping in sport - and athletics in particular. Russian athletes are currently banned from international competition unless they can satisfy strict criteria to show they are clean.\nMore than 100 Olympic athletes who competed at the 2008 and 2012 Games have been sanctioned for doping after the International Olympic Committee embarked on a programme of retesting old samples.\n\"There are records in which people in the sport, the media and the public do not have complete confidence,\" added taskforce chair Pierce O'Callaghan.\nIAAF president Lord Coe said the changes were \"a step in the right direction\".\n\"There will be athletes, current record holders, who will feel that the history we are recalibrating will take something away from them, but if organised and structured properly we have a good chance of winning back credibility in this area,\" he said.\nEuropean Athletics president Hansen said he would encourage the IAAF to adopt the proposal at its August council meeting.\n\"What we are proposing is revolutionary and not just because most world and European records will have to be replaced,\" Hansen added.\n\"We want to raise the standards for recognition to a point where everyone can be confident that everything is fair and above board.\"\nRadcliffe has previously criticised plans to wipe records from the books and last month told BBC Sport she favoured making doping a criminal offence instead to deter cheats.\nShe issued a statement on Monday criticising the new proposals and athletics governing bodies.\n\"I worked extremely hard for my PBs and they will always be valid to me. I know they were set through hard work and best effort and abiding by all the rules and am proud of them,\" Radcliffe wrote.\n\"Governing bodies have a duty to protect every clean athlete, here they again fail those athletes. We had to compete against cheats, they couldn't provide us a level playing field, we lost out on medals, moments and earnings due to cheats, saw our sport dragged through the mud due to cheats and now, thanks to those who cheat we potentially lose our World and Area records.\n\"Although we are moving forward I don't believe we are yet at the point where we have a testing procedure capable of catching every cheat out there, so why reset at this point? Do we really believe a record set in 2015 is totally clean and one in 1995 not?\n\"I am hurt and do feel this damages my reputation and dignity. It is a heavy handed way to wipe out some really suspicious records in a cowardly way by simply sweeping all aside instead of having the guts to take the legal plunge and wipe any record that would be found in a court of law to have been illegally assisted.\n\"It is confusing to the public at a time when athletics already struggles to market itself. How do they explain how stadium, club and national records are better than the Area or World marks or will they force all those to be to wiped out too?\"",

    "Salvador Sobral's success with Amar Pelos Dois (Love for Both of Us) has made him a national hero.\nWearing a plain black suit he delivered an emotionally charged song without the theatrics that often accompany other Eurovision acts.\nPreviously Portugal had never got above the sixth place that it reached in 1996.\nIt was a triumph for \"brand Portugal\", music journalist and advertising executive Manuel Falcao told the BBC.\n\"The Portuguese language is present worldwide but sometimes it's hard for the national identity to make an impression, so for the brand this is very nice - people are very happy,\" he said.\nThe timing was fortunate for Portugal, as the nation shows signs of recovery from the 2008 financial crisis and a massive bailout from its eurozone partners.\n\"Polls show people are more optimistic here than three years ago, the economic indicators are not strong but positive - even by EU standards,\" Mr Falcao said.\nEurovision success \"coincided with a good mood in Portugal - we won the Euro 2016 football championship and tourism here is beating all records\", he said.\nHe cautioned, however, that one song would not make a radical difference.\nIt was a doubly memorable weekend for Portugal, as Pope Francis drew a vast crowd to the Fatima shrine, where he made saints of two Portuguese children. Their visions of the Virgin Mary in 1917 turned Fatima into a top Catholic pilgrimage site.\nThere is national pride that Sobral's song Amar Pelos Dois touched so many hearts, in a competition dominated by English lyrics.\n\"The language, more than the Portuguese language, was music,\" Sobral said.\nThe song was crafted by his sister Luisa, an accomplished singer-songwriter and music college graduate, with several CDs to her name.\nA fellow Portuguese music expert, Sofia Vieira Lopes, said the song's triumph proved that lyrics were not fundamental to a musical message.\n\"It shows that it's not necessary to sing in English to understand the music,\" she told Portugal's Publico daily.\nSalvador Sobral criticised the commercialisation of pop, after his Saturday night triumph in Ukraine, speaking contemptuously of \"fast-food music\".\n\"This is a vote for people who actually mean something with their music,\" he said. \"Music is not fireworks, music is feeling.\"\nThe state tourism authority, Turismo de Portugal, is thrilled by the boost to the country's image.\n\"We are in the spotlight,\" its president Luis Araujo told the daily Diario de Noticias (DN). He characterised the winning song as \"simplicity, transparency, honesty\".\nThe melancholy, bittersweet lyrics include the lines: \"My darling, listen to my prayers / I beg you to come back, come back to love me / I know we can't love alone.\"\nThere was a poignancy to Sobral's performance, as he has struggled with a serious heart condition.\nHis success shows there is still a market for national musical traditions, despite the dominance of Anglo-American pop culture.\nPortugal requires broadcasters to observe a quota of Portuguese-language songs. France and Spain have similar quotas, to showcase home-grown talent.\nEven before the Eurovision final Sobral's song was hugely popular in Portugal, Mr Falcao said.\nYet English remains the default pop language, even in Portugal, he said.\nAnd Salvador Sobral himself has recorded covers of American hits - in English.",

Only Liam Foster-Jones, of the three unemployed friends, seems certain about who the imperious features and swept-back helmet of hair might belong to.\n\"It's Margaret Thatcher,\" he says.\nThe name doesn't seem to mean much to them.\nIt would have been a different story 36 years ago, when the Thatcher government closed Consett's steel works, with the loss of 3,700 jobs.\nThe devastation inflicted on this remote town high on the edge of the Pennines, where unemployment soared to 36%, made the national news and became a symbol of the harsh medicine the Thatcher government thought it had to administer to Britain's heavy industries.\nIt sowed the seeds for the electoral wipe out the Conservatives would experience across large parts of Northern England and Scotland, which it still trying to recover from today.\nThatcher and \"the Tories\" remain dirty words to the former steel workers in Consett but few young people I spoke to could recognise her and those that did regarded her as a distant historical figure.\n\"I don't really have an opinion [about her] but my dad doesn't like her because she shut down the steel works,\" said 20-year-old Adam Stokoe.\n\"So my dad has strong opinions about that. I'm not from that time period so I don't really think about it that way. I only think about now. What's going to benefit me.\"\nConsett has never had a Conservative MP but the Tory vote held up surprisingly well in other parts of the North-East while Thatcher was in power. In 1983, the party took 34% of North East votes, and had five MPs.\nIt was only after she left office that anti-Tory attitudes really hardened, with the party's share of the vote slumping by 10%. It currently has just three MPs in the region.\nTheresa May is attempting to change that on 8 June and has urged traditional Labour supporters to \"lend\" her their vote.\nShe will have experienced at first hand how difficult it is to break the voting habits of a lifetime in this part of the world when she stood for election in North West Durham in 1992.\n(By a strange coincidence, Lib Dem leader Tim Farron was also standing for Parliament for the first time that year in the same constituency.)\nThey still remember Mrs May at Consett Working Men's Club - because, claims the barman, they wouldn't let her through the door.\nIt had nothing to do with her politics, he adds, it's just that the club is one of a tiny handful left in the UK that does not admit women.\n\"Your wife can't chase you in here,\" says one regular, looking up from his racing form. He doesn't want to talk about politics.\nMrs May won 28% of the vote in North West Durham - a score that has not been beaten by a Conservative candidate there since - but although one local poll put the party in with a chance of winning on 8 June it is not high on their target list.\nThere was certainly little enthusiasm for Mrs May's brand of Conservatism in the town's Steel Club, although the lifelong Labour voters I spoke to were equally scathing about their traditional party of choice.\n\"I don't like Jeremy Corbyn. He hasn't got a brain in his head as far as I'm concerned,\" said Christopher Bell, a 69-year-old retired steel worker and club steward.\nHe and his partner, Linda, voted for Brexit in last year's referendum and are worried about the strain they say is being placed on local services by East European immigrants.\nLinda, who voted UKIP in 2015, said she would not return to the Labour fold until the party was led by \"somebody that's going to stand up for English people, working class people - because the Conservatives like the rich and they like to keep them rich\".\nThirty miles south in Darlington, a constituency with a narrower Labour majority of just over 3,000, people seemed more receptive to the Conservative message.\nThe town has had a Tory MP before - Defence Secretary Michael Fallon in the 1980s - and the party has hopes of retaking the seat on 8 June.\n\"I will vote for Theresa May. Not necessarily because she's a Conservative but I think she's the only person for the job. Given the other options,\" says Alex Blackham, owner of a cafe in the town's indoor market.\n\"If she'd been Labour or an independent then I would have been voting for her as a person. I think that's what politics comes down to sometimes.\"\nClive Hinson, a 59-year-old assembly line worker who was about to tuck into one of Mr Blackham's full English breakfasts, blames Thatcher for the closure of the dump truck factory he worked at in the 1980s.\nBut he adds: \"Funnily enough, I'll be voting Conservative. Because I think Corbyn is a waste of time.\n\"He can't give a definitive answer on defence. He's got all these plans for spending loads of money but the figures just don't add up....so much though I don't want to vote Conservative that's the way I'm voting.\"\nHe says the North East has \"forgiven but not forgotten\" Thatcher, comparing the reconciliation process to what happened in Northern Ireland or South Africa. Like Mr Blackham he voted for Brexit in last year's EU referendum.\nMost of the older working class people I spoke to - the traditional bedrock of Labour support in the area - needed no prompting to criticise what they saw as Jeremy Corbyn's lack of leadership ability and charisma.\nHe seemed to go over much better with younger, more cosmopolitan voters.\n\"I would vote Corbyn all day every day,\" said Stephen Lock, who runs a comic book stall in the covered market with wife June.\n\"He's such a man of the people by the looks of it. He's looking after the general working people. He seems to have great ideas. They may be a little outdated in the modern day, but he's not the person they're painting him out to be. They are trying to make him out to be weak and I don't think he is.\"\nThe couple returned from 13 years in France, where they had a gardening business, after the Brexit vote. \"We thought we had better come back and do something else here. It's affected us quite heavily,\" said Stephen.\nThey are torn between voting Labour and Liberal Democrats - and are not impressed by what they see as the disloyalty of Labour MPs who openly criticise their leader.\n\"The Labour Party is shooting itself in the foot by not acting and standing as one,\" said June.\n\"You have got career politicians that are more concerned about their own personal interests than their constituents.\"\nThere also appeared to real enthusiasm for Corbyn among Darlington's student population, who blame the media for portraying him in a negative light.\n\"You don't see a lot of coverage of, like, nice things about him,\" said 18-year-old Emily Frewin. \"But when you actually read into it he is a nice person.\"\nTheresa May avoids talking to the voters, she adds, but \"he seems like he wants to talk to everybody, not just the rich people\".\n\"He does seem to be getting slandered quite a lot,\" agrees 20-year-old software development student Josh Walker, \"when he's trying to fight for us.\"\nIf the Thatcher factor was ever a major impediment to a Tory revival in the North East, it has undoubtedly faded with time.\nThe party's tactic of detaching Theresa May's name - it was emblazoned across the battle bus she toured the North-East in - from the Conservative brand appears to be working with some voters, who might feel a little queasy at the prospect of putting their cross next to a Tory candidate.\nSome told me they had flirted with a Conservative vote, only to think better of it - Mrs May's support for a free vote on fox hunting, not an issue that has exactly dominated the airwaves, was mentioned by several people as a reason for not switching to the Tories.\nAnd there will always be some who will never forget, or forgive. Like the Darlington woman who greeted Theresa May's name with a horrified cry of \"she's another Maggie Thatcher!\".\nBut on the basis of this highly unscientific sample, Thatcher is no longer the bogey figure she was and Labour can no longer rely on the loyalty of its traditional support base.",
    "And perhaps to some it may seem bullish to deny the youngest kids a free lunch, even if free breakfast is on offer.\nThe move has sparked taunts of \"May, the meals snatcher\" - reminiscent of Margaret Thatcher's infamous cancelling of free school milk.\nBut to Theresa May's Conservatives it was a policy that no longer added up.\nThe party does not believe \"a free school lunch for every child in the first three years of primary school... is a sensible use of public money\".\nIt's one of those tough decisions - but a free breakfast, cheap at a 10th of the price, now seems a more desirable alternative to the Conservatives - although the value of the free-lunch scheme has never been assessed.\nFor some, the idea - brought in by the coalition government in 2014  - was always too expensive.\nIt was very much a Liberal Democrat policy and plans were announced by Nick Clegg at his party's conference in 2013.\nIt was not long before his man in the education department, the then schools minister David Laws, was accused of understating the costs of the policy itself.\nThis he denied, but the then Education Secretary Michael Gove sought reassurance from the Treasury that schools would not be forced \"to subsidise meals by reducing their spending on teaching and learning\".\nThose opposed also started to claim it might cut into the budget used to provide much-needed extra school places.\nAnd in a sense, the Conservatives do not want to be seen to be funding free dinners when in this tougher school-funding climate heads are saying they are unable to pay for some of the basics.\nThey say the pressures on their budgets are much more about the unfunded extra costs of teachers' pay, pensions and national contributions.\nValentine Mulholland, head of policy at the National Association of Head Teachers, said: \"After the nightmare of bringing this policy in at breakneck speed and all the capital funding spent to upgrade kitchens and dining facilities, it's pretty sad to see this U-turn.\"\nA BBC News Freedom of Information request just six months before it was due to come into force, in September 2014, found 2,700 primary schools needed new catering facilities before they could even think about offering free meals to all infant pupils.\nPrimary school heads had complained they were being asked to do something undeliverable in the time allowed.\nIn any event, as they so often do, schools managed the challenge that landed in their laps.\nPerhaps this is why teachers and heads appear to feel so upset at the idea of scrapping free lunches - even if breakfast is being offered instead.\nNational Union of Teachers general secretary Kevin Courtney said cancelling the universal offer of a hot meal in the day is \"mean-spirited and wrong-headed\".\nThe policy did not make sense, or represent value for money, given the investment many schools had already made in kitchens and staffing, he said.\n\"It is a long time for a child to go without food from the morning until 3:30pm, which will be the case for many families in work but struggling.\"\nMr Courtney's claim may seem alarmist to some, but it will ring true for many teachers, who often raise the issue of pupil hunger.\nNicky Gillhespie, school business manager at Cheam Fields Primary, said things were very different before her school introduced free school meals.\n\"We had children coming in with nothing.\n\"There were some who'd been given a pound by their parents to stop and get something in the sweet shop for lunch on the way to school,\" she said.\nThe school in Cheam, south London, had no kitchen when the free school meals pledge was made and dinners were driven over to the school by a catering firm.\n\"Burgers were kept warm in trays of hot water, for example, so they looked really pale and the children just didn't want to eat them,\" she said.\nSince then, with the help of a government-funded kitchen pod worth \u00c2\u00a370,000, the school has seen a complete change of culture.\nUptake on meals went from about 85 to 300 a day - and there were some individual success stories.\n\"There was one girl who would only eat rice and now she eats a full diet, like all the other children,\" Miss Gillhespie said.\n\"It did enable us to change the whole culture of the school - but without that being funded, I do think that it's going to be eroded away.\n\"Parents still think \u00c2\u00a32.30 is too much to pay for a meal and if they've got two children or even three or four, it's a lot of money.\n\"There must be so many children on that breadline, who wouldn't be entitled to free school meals, but will now be put off because they have to pay for it.\"",
    "The mosaics, part of a 1,700-year-old town house, were found on the site of a development in Leicester.\nOpen days attracted thousands of people but a question mark hung over the fate over the most spectacular finds.\nNow city mayor Sir Peter Soulsby has confirmed they will form part of a \u00c2\u00a37m revamp of the nearby Jewry Wall museum.\nThe excavation recovered hundreds of artefacts - including a gruesome carved handle depicting people being fed to lions - but the mosaics were the largest found in the city for 150 years.\nSpeaking at the final open day on Sunday, archaeologist Jon Coward said: \"The big mosaic will be lifted and conserved but quite where it will end up I couldn't tell you but it should be made available.\n\"One of the things that could happen is it could go in the Jewry Wall Museum or it could go in the foyer of the building on this site, that is up to the developers.\"\nSir Peter Soulsby said has now said that after discussions with developers and archaeologists, a decision had been made.\n\"The Jewry Wall Museum is the obvious place for this to go and after 1,700 years beneath our feet they could not have been found at a better time.\n\"Other mosaics are currently undergoing restoration so this mosaic will join the wonderful artefacts we already have to  make a world class visitor attraction.\"\nIt is hoped the refurbished museum will open in two years.",
    "There is no doubt what this election is about for the Conservatives. Theresa May has repeated \"strong and stable\" and it does not seem as though she will stop any time soon.\nThe prime minister is determined to make this election about Brexit and how a vote for the Tories means a vote for her to have a \"strong hand\" at the negotiating table with the EU.\nAn added dimension to this election is the potential for the Conservatives to make significant gains in Wales.\nRecent polling data from the Wales Governance Centre suggests the Conservatives may be on course to become the largest party in Wales, a huge electoral breakthrough which would see the Labour Party losing its position as the dominant party in Wales, which it has held since 1922.\nThe significance of this was not lost on the Conservatives.\nAlmost immediately after the first piece of polling data suggested a Tory breakthrough, Theresa May held an event in Bridgend, a constituency high up in the party's targets in Wales.\nAs noted by Prof Laura McAllister, losing Bridgend would be a symbolic blow for Welsh Labour as it is the assembly seat of First Minister Carwyn Jones.\nIn order for the Conservatives to win seats like Bridgend, the party is determined to push the narrative of May vs Corbyn.\nThe opinion polls do not reflect favourably on Labour's leader in Wales and Mrs May will be repeating mantras about \"strong and stable\" leadership and Mr Corbyn's potential \"coalition of chaos\".\nThe repetition of these phrases is likely to draw groans every time they are used, but Mrs May is determined to hammer home the point that the choice is between her and Mr Corbyn on 8 June.\nThis is being done to the extent that Welsh Conservative election posters focus on Theresa May and do not focus much on \"Welsh\" Conservatives.\nAs well as attacking Mr Corbyn, this election is also being campaigned on Brexit.\nThe mantra of \"strong and stable leadership\" in Brexit negotiations will appeal to those who want to see a tough stance towards the EU and it has already seen votes haemorrhaging from UKIP to the Conservatives.\nThe Welsh Political Barometer survey for 5-7 May asked the question: \"Which political party do you think would best handle Britain's exit from the EU?\".\nThe Conservatives were by far the most-trusted party in this regard. They will want to highlight this throughout the campaign.\nHowever, the Tories in Wales will have to battle against a Welsh Labour Party that has proved resilient in the face of difficult circumstances.\nLabour performed better than expected in the recent local elections and it will argue this was down to the \"Welsh Labour\" brand.\nIt remains to be seen whether Welsh Labour's tactic to focus on Welsh issues and to try and shift the narrative away from May vs Corbyn will be effective, but the Conservatives need to be mindful of this.\nThe party has been accused recently of imposing candidates on local parties, upsetting some local members.\nIf Labour try to make this election about local issues, it may spell danger for the Tories: Labour will accuse Tory HQ of taking local voters for granted by imposing candidates with no links to the local area.\nResponding to the Conservative candidate selection in their constituency, a Labour candidate complained that \"Tory candidate chosen by Theresa May & CCHQ means a puppet MP supporting the PM's hard Brexit no matter the cost to jobs, business and environment\".\nThey argued the election is a choice between \"unrestrained Tory government or independent-minded local MPs\".\nTheresa May and the Conservatives need to be careful that Welsh Labour are not able to change the narrative.\nElections are never easy to predict and there is still time for opinion polls to shift and previous projections be deemed obsolete.\nBut as we approach 8 June, there is the potential for this election to cause a huge change in the political map of Wales - a map turning from red to blue.",

    "Portugal international centre-back Alves became Caixinha's first signing as Rangers boss last week.\nAnd McCarthy, who was at Porto when Alves was breaking through, insists he will prove a shrewd capture.\n\"He'll bring something different to Rangers and beef up their defence, so he's the right defender to bring in,\" McCarthy told BBC Scotland.\n\"Bruno has a wealth of experience, he's played at the highest level and he's a winner.\n\"He'll give them a bit more stability at the back, more bite, he's a leader and he'll organise that defence. His communication won't be a problem because his English is very good.\n\"Bruno is very composed and calm on the ball so he will help the way the manager wants to play things from the back. Bruno is the perfect fit for what the manager is trying to bring to Rangers right now.\"\nAs impressed as McCarthy is by the signing of Alves, he reckons Rangers will have to bring in a few more players of a similar calibre before they will be in a position to seriously challenge Celtic.\nBrendan Rodgers' side finished 39 points ahead of the Ibrox outfit as they won the Premiership and went on to secure an unbeaten domestic treble.\n\"I'm not too sure he'll be able to change that because Celtic are so strong,\" McCarthy said. \"It's going to take more than one Bruno Alves in that Rangers side to take the title from Celtic, but if they sign a couple more players like Bruno, then I think Rangers are in with a shout of giving Celtic a run for their money.\"\nAlves began his career at Porto and had various loan spells before becoming a first-team regular, winning nine major honour with the Dragons.\nHe joined Zenit Saint Petersburg for \u00a318m in 2010, with whom he won two league titles and the Russian Super Cup before joining Turkish giants Fenerbahce for \u00a34.5m in 2013.\nThere he won one league title and the Turkish Super Cup and then in 2016 he moved to Italian Serie A side Cagliari, from whom he joined Rangers.\nPart of the Portugal squad that won the European Championships in 2016, Alves has 89 caps for his national side, and McCarthy is convinced the defender has a lot more football left in him, despite being 35 years old.\n\"He's a fitness fanatic and looks after himself exceptionally well so that will keep him going for a few years,\" he added. \"The experience that he'll bring, Rangers really need it from what I've seen last season.\"\nAnd the South African has assured Rangers fans that while Alves is the type of robust defender they need, he will not be a regular in the notebooks of Scotland's referees.\n\"Everybody has a bit of temper in him but Bruno will choose his moments wisely, he's a senior player in that squad and he has to be an example,\" McCarthy added.\n\"He can't do silly things that leave the team hanging because they will depend on his experience and to guide the young players.

    "It forced the band to remain anonymous for almost a year: No photographs, no interviews, no videos.\nBut there was an upside. Last year, as she caught a train home from Heathrow, she sat next to a passenger \"covered in blood [with] no teeth, looking sorry for himself\".\n\"I tentatively went up to him and his girlfriend and said, 'I just wanted to let you know you'll be fine',\" recalls the 27-year-old.\n\"'Go to the dentist tomorrow, don't panic, you'll be great'. And he was like, 'Oh, thank you so much!'.\n\"And then this guy opposite us piped up, 'I broke my nose, too!'. And suddenly this whole little carriage was talking about their injuries, which was remarkable.\n\"When I got off the Tube, I was so excited. Chatting to strangers gives you such a buzz because there's that element of fear before you talk to someone.\n\"So I walked from Brockley station back to my house, singing into my phone. And I've got this really funny voice note, which is like, 'I'm getting high on humans!'\"\nLater, Josephine sent the melody to her musical partner, Anthony West, saying, \"We have to write a song about this tomorrow\".\n\"I just sent a text back saying, 'You're crazy,'\" he laughs, but the demo was worked up into a full song, High on Humans, which features on the band's upcoming second album, Ultralife.\nLike her Tube journey, the song tingles with nervous energy, capturing that extraordinary feeling of connecting with other people; a theme that runs through the record.\nThe duo were moved to write about \"what it means to be a human in this day and age\" after a head-spinning two years, in which their music became an online phenomenon, resulting in a record deal and a tour that ran to more than 200 shows around the world.\nThe success caught them completely off guard. Oh Wonder was conceived as a songwriting project, whereby the two musicians could subsidise their solo careers by giving songs to other artists.\nIn September 2014, they created a Soundcloud page and, prompted to describe themselves, wrote: \"Writing duo, one song a month\".\n\"We thought it was a good way to build up a portfolio over a year,\" explains Josephine. Then their first song, Body Gold, amassed 100,000 plays in just three days.\n\"We thought it was a fluke,\" says Anthony. \"But then we uploaded something the next month, and the same thing happened. And it just kept snowballing.\n\"On the first of every month, we'd go to a little coffee shop and just release a song and thousands of people would play it. It was amazing. It was the best year ever.\"\nInitially, they stayed incognito - partly because of their mantra \"it's about the art, not the artist\", but mainly because of Josephine's injuries.\n\"I had no teeth,\" she grimaces. \"It was a really ill-timed accident.\"\n\"For a while, she had a little lisp,\" adds Anthony, who had to edit all of his partner's vocals to remove the erroneous \"esses\".\nRecording on a budget of just \u00c2\u00a3200, they hit upon a vocal style where both musicians sing in unison, with Josephine's voice in the centre, and Anthony singing twice, once in the left ear and once in the right.\nThe technique was actually a happy accident - they'd recorded two sets of vocals so the songs could be pitched to both male and female artists, but their managers advised them to blend the two takes, and it became Oh Wonder's unique sonic signature.\nFans, it seemed, couldn't get enough of it.\n\"Because we released a song a month over a long period, our fans had a year of their lives soundtracked by our music,\" says Josephine.\n\"Rather than just, 'Oh, I really like that song you did,' we get, 'You released that song when I was at university or I had moved to a different country'. We get the most heart-warming stories. Hundreds a week.\"\nAnthony recalls a gig in Grand Rapids, Michigan, where a 50-year-old woman approached the band to express her gratitude for the band's music. Her son, who had recently died of cancer, had been a fan. In his final months, they would wait on tenterhooks for every new release.\n\"When he died, she was with him and they were listening to his favourite song,\" says Anthony. \"And she said, 'I thank you so much because now, when I listen to that song, my son is there with me.'\"\nStories like that helped alleviate the drudgery and loneliness of touring - \"when you go from 3,000 people screaming your name to being back in the dressing room, on your own, eating a yoghurt.\"\nBeing whisked around the world has changed the two musicians in ways they never expected.\n\"I've found that I've become fiercely loyal now,\" says Josephine. \"If someone has an engagement party and I've said I will be there, I will cancel everything, even if it really compromises things, in order to make it.\"\nAnd that, in a nutshell, is what Ultralife - both the album and its title track - is about.\n\"You and I will both have days where we're really sad, like, 'it's Friday night and I'm in on my own and there's no food in the fridge and I'm miserable,'\" says Josephine.\n\"And the next day you wake up and you're like, 'I feel fantastic, I feel so liberated and empowered and I have loads of mates and it's incredible.'\n\"Ultralife is the word we use to symbolise the someone or something in your life that pulls you out of those trickier moments and into the celebratory, ultra version of yourself.\"\nSo who is that person for Oh Wonder?\n\"We haven't been asked that yet!\" laughs Josephine, before Anthony chips in with a vague answer about friends and family.\nMany assume the duo are a real-life couple - but they have been doggedly reluctant to discuss a potential romance, even though they live together and have an uncanny knack for finishing each other's sentences.\n\"People think we're brother and sister, which suits us just fine,\" Josephine told one interviewer.\nInstead, they want the focus to be their music, which they wrote eyeball-to-eyeball over a piano in a rented AirB&B apartment in New York.\nCompared to their first album, Ultralife is \"pumped full of energy\", a direct response to the audience's reactions on their last tour.\nSonically, it's a big leap forward, while retaining all of the breathless boy-girl beauty of their debut.\nThe band don't want the album to propel them to Beyonce levels of fame (\"I think it would just be very lonely,\" says Josephine), but it could jeopardise their chances of striking up anonymous conversations on the Tube.\nWhich, as Anthony attests, could be a blessing.\n\"I once sat with a Danish friend on the Tube,\" he says, \"And there was two girls opposite me talking in a foreign language.\n\"Later, my friend told me they were Danish, too, and they were tearing into my shoes, talking about how awful they were.\n\"I thought they were quite normal shoes, honestly.\"\nOh Wonder's new album, Ultralife, is released on 14 July by Island Records.\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

    "Fast forward about 20 years, and it's fair to say he has done just that.\nThe business he runs, Frasers Hospitality, is one of the world's biggest providers of high-end serviced apartments. Its 148 properties span about 80 capital cities, as well as financial hubs across Europe, Asia, the Middle East and Africa.\nBut it almost didn't get off the ground.\nWhen Mr Choe was appointed to launch and lead the company, Asia was booming; the tiger economies of Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore were expanding rapidly.\nBut as Frasers prepared to open its first two properties in Singapore, the Asian financial crisis hit.\nIt was 1997. Currencies went into freefall. Suddenly, people were losing their jobs and stopped travelling.\nMr Choe recalls asking staff if they really wanted to continue working with the firm, because when the properties opened they might not get paid.\n\"It was really that serious,\" he says. \"I remember tearing up because they said 'let's open it, let's open it whether you can pay us or not'.\"\nSurvival, Mr Choe admits, came through a bit of luck, and the misfortune of others.\nHe had convinced the board at parent firm, property group Frasers Centrepoint, to open serviced apartments rather than hotels - partly because getting planning permission in Singapore was easier.\nBut he also sensed it was a big, untapped market. And at the time of the crisis, it proved to be exactly what customers wanted.\n\"As we were going through this difficult patch, there were protests and riots in Jakarta,\" he says. \"A lot of companies like Microsoft called up looking for rooms for their staff because they were moving out of Jakarta.\"\nFrasers' 412 apartments were quickly in demand. Occupancy soon hit 70%, and then 90%.\nExplaining the popularity of serviced apartments, Mr Choe says that if people are staying somewhere for just a few days, they happily stay in hotels, but if they are going to be somewhere for one month to eight months, the walls of hotel rooms \"close in on you\".\nBut now, Mr Choe, 57, faces new challenges - the travel tastes of millennials and the disruptive nature of Airbnb.\n\"The way to tackle Airbnb is not to ignore it. I will never underestimate Airbnb,\" he says.\nThere's been no significant impact on Frasers yet. Big corporations still prefer to put employees in big service apartments, he says, because they can guarantee a level of safety and security. But that is likely to change, Mr Choe admits.\n\"I have two daughters who to my chagrin use Airbnb,\" he says. \"We took a family trip to Florence and I stayed in this wonderful boutique hotel, but paid a bundle for it.\n\"When my daughter joined us, she said, 'I'm just staying next door and paying about 80 euros'. We paid about 330 euros.\n\"I asked why they stayed at Airbnb. They say 'it's like a surprise, it's part of the adventure'.\"\nAnd so now, Mr Choe wants to bring some of that vibrancy to Frasers.\nWhile neutral colours, beige curtains and dark wooden chairs dominate its more traditional apartments, many customers want something different, and this is shaping Fraser's strategy.\nIn 2015 it bought Malmaison Hotel du Vin, a UK hotel group that specialises in developing heritage properties into upscale boutique hotels.\nThat has taken them beyond financial centres, including to Shakespeare's hometown of Stratford-upon-Avon. Or, an intrepid traveller with $500 (\u00c2\u00a3325) to spend could have a night in a converted medieval prison in Oxford.\nAnd Frasers has launched the Capri sub-brand - whose website promises \"inspiring art and inspirational tech\".\nOn a day-to-day basis Mr Choe says he still draws on his experience as a young man, who - having been given a scholarship by the Shangri-La hotel group to study at Cornell University in the US - came back to Asia to learn about the hospitality industry.\n\"They put me in every department conceivable. I remember one of the toughest jobs I had was in the butchery. I had to carve an entire cow. For one month, I could not eat meat.\n\"I'm thankful for those experiences. When you step into a hotel, you immediately pick up what works and what doesn't work.\n\"When I see the check-in staff walking more than three steps, I know the counter is set up wrong.\n\"It's like a cockpit.

    "Haroon Syed, of west London, admitted preparing acts of terrorism after trying to source weapons including a suicide bomb and machine gun.\nHe was caught after approaching MI5 officers, who were posing as a fellow extremist, via social media.\nSyed was sentenced to a minimum of 16 years and six months.\nLast year, his brother was jailed for life for plotting to behead someone on Remembrance Sunday.\nJudge Michael Topolski QC said Syed wanted to carry out \"an act of mass murder\" and therefore a discretionary life sentence was warranted.\nProsecutors say Syed's plans ranged from becoming a suicide bomber to staging a gun attack, and while he initially boasted of working with others, those people did not materialise.\nInstead, over the summer of last year, he made increasingly urgent efforts to secure weaponry.\nAfter he went online looking for help, a purported jihadist fighting overseas, known only as Abu Isa, introduced him to another extremist going by the name Abu Yusuf.\nThis second man was, in fact, a group of MI5 officers who were playing the role of a jihadist in what became weeks of social media chat with Syed.\nTeen admits planning 'London bomb attack'\nDuncan Penny QC, prosecuting, told the Old Bailey there was initially some \"suspicion on both sides\" before Abu Yusuf concluded that Syed was a \"committed brother\" he could deal with.\nSyed then began talking about his aspirations and gave his contact a shopping list, saying he wanted \"do martyrdom\" after first causing \"damage\" with a machine gun.\n\"Can you get the gear?\" asked Syed. \"You will be involved right?\n\"Two things. Number one, machine gun and we need someone who can make a vest you know the dugma [button] one. So after some damage with machine gun then do itishadi [martyrdom] ... that's what I'm planning to do.\"\nThe undercover officer told Syed guns were expensive - but he might be able to get someone to build a bomb. Syed floated the idea of going to fight overseas with his new-found friend - but revealed his passport had been cancelled by the authorities.\nHe tried and failed twice to get fraudulent loans of thousands of pounds to cover the cost of firearms - and eventually agreed to meet his contact in a coffee shop in Slough, Berkshire, to finalise an alternative plan.\nOver two meetings, he talked about his aspirations and then handed over \u00c2\u00a3150, asking for a bomb packed with nails. The conversation was secretly recorded.\n\"I was thinking of Oxford Street,\" he told his contact. \"If you put those things inside called nails, do you know what that is, nails? Those sharp things - lots of them inside.\n\"Good man, can't wait akhi [brother]. If I go to prison, I go to prison. If I die, I die, you understand? I have got to get to Jannah [heaven].\"\nThe undercover officer later told Syed a \"bomb-making brother\" would have the device ready within days - and the suspect went online to narrow his list of targets.\nHis web searches included \"packed places in London\" and \"Elton John, Hyde Park, 11 September\" - a major concert hosted by BBC Radio 2 which also featured Status Quo and Madness.\nProsecutors say Syed's character had begun to change outwardly in late 2014, coinciding with the growing support among British extremists for the self-styled Islamic State group.\nDuring the course of the investigation, detectives found his web searches jumped about as he tried to satisfy himself that an attack on civilians was theologically justifiable.\nOne of his last searches, a week before his arrest, was: \"How can I stop being upset about the UK killing innocent Syrians and get on with my day?\"\nWhen counter-terrorist detectives arrested him in September and asked him for the password for his phone, he replied: \"ISIS - you like that?\"\nSyed's was one of 18 terror plots to have been foiled since 2013.\nMitigating, Mark Summers QC said it was a \"crude, ill-thought-out\" plan made at the behest of others.\nThe court heard Syed had fallen under the influence of members of banned extremist group Al-Muhajiroun, and that he now publicly rejected his past beliefs and condemned the recent bomb attack in Manchester.\nBut Judge Topolski told Syed: \"You were not lured, you were not enticed, you were not entrapped.\n\"You became, and in my judgement as shown by your online activities away from your contact with Abu Yusuf, deeply committed to the ideology of a brutal and barbaric organisation that sought to hijack and corrupt an ancient and venerable religion for its own purposes and you wanted to be part of it.\"\nDeb Walsh, deputy head of the counter-terrorism division of the Crown Prosecution Service, said: \"Haroon Syed is clearly a danger to the public who was prepared to carry out indiscriminate attacks against innocent people.\n\"The compelling evidence presented by the CPS left him with no choice but to plead guilty.\"",

    "The 11-month-old is on life support at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH).\nCharlie has an exceptionally rare genetic condition called encephalomyopathic mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome (MDDS).\nAlthough he appeared perfectly healthy when he was born, his health soon began to deteriorate.\nCharlie now has severe brain damage.\nHe cannot open his eyes or move his arms or legs.\nHis condition also means he is unable to breathe unaided, which is why he needs to be on a ventilator.\nCharlie's heart, liver and kidneys are also affected, and his doctors say it is not clear if he feels pain.\nCharlie's parents, Connie Yates and Chris Gard, from Bedfont in west London, want Charlie to have an experimental treatment called nucleoside therapy.\nA hospital in the US has agreed to offer Charlie the treatment, and Charlie's parents have raised funds to take him there.\nBut Charlie's doctors at GOSH do not think this is the right care for Charlie.\nThey say they have explored various treatment options, including nucleoside drug therapy, and none would improve Charlie's quality of life.\nThey say Charlie's life support should be switched off and he should be allowed to die.\nCharlie's doctors say his brain is extensively damaged at a cellular level.\nThey say the US clinician offering the experimental treatment agrees it will not reverse this brain damage.\nGOSH applied to the High Court for judges to decide Charlie's future.\nThe High Court agreed with the GOSH doctors.\nCharlie's parents then appealed against the decision, but courts ruled that the original decision should stand and that it would be in Charlie's best interests to be allowed to die with dignity.\nGOSH says it has applied to the High Court for a fresh hearing \"in light of claims of new evidence\" relating to potential treatment for Charlie's condition.\nTwo international hospitals and their researchers have been in touch with GOSH with more information about nucleoside therapy - drugs designed to help treat MDDS.\nMeanwhile, the Pope and US President Donald Trump have offered to intervene and support Charlie's parents' plea.\nEnd of Twitter post  by @realDonaldTrump\nThe president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, however, says such interventions from high-profile figures, no matter how well-intended, are \"unhelpful\".\nCharlie's doctors say their view has not changed - they still think the experimental treatment would be unjustified.\nBut they believe it is right to seek the High Court's view again.\nThe therapy is a treatment, not a cure. And it is highly experimental.\nIt has been used on some patients, but none with Charlie's type of MDDS.\nThere haven't yet been any trials in mice to see if it would work in Charlie's condition, which is caused by a mutation of a gene called RRM2B. The faulty DNA means Charlie's cells can't easily make energy to power his muscles and brain.\nDoctors say it doesn't look as though there will be time to run such tests before reaching a decision about Charlie's care.\nGOSH did apply for ethical permission to attempt nucleoside therapy on Charlie.\nBy the time that decision was made, however, Charlie's condition had greatly worsened and the view was that his brain damage was too severe and irreversible for the treatment to help.\nProf Julian Savulescu, an independent ethics expert at the University of Oxford, said: \"More than six months have passed since experimental therapy was first considered. We don't know how bad Charlie's brain damage is now. Whether experimental therapy is still warranted depends on whether there remains any prospect of any meaningful life.\"\nThe High Court is now being asked to judge the evidence on this crucial point.",

    "Days after news that Flight AC759 from Toronto was involved in a near-miss it has emerged just how close it came to crashing into four planes on a taxiway.\nThe incident on 7 July occurred after the pilot \"inadvertently\" headed for the area where jets were due to depart.\nHe was ordered to pull up and the Airbus 320 circled and landed safely.\nAs the plane approached the taxiway, which runs parallel to the runway, it is estimated that it flew just 30m above two aircraft waiting to depart, a preliminary report by Canada's Transportation Safety Board (TSB) said.\nAfter receiving a warning, the pilot pulled up and the plane rose about 60m above a third jet and about 90m above a fourth, the TSB said.\nFlight AC759 had already travelled almost 400m over the taxiway before aborting the landing, the board's report added.\nThe pilot then made another successful approach. No injuries were reported.\nThe flight was scheduled to land at 23:23 local time (06:23 GMT) but touched down at 00:11.\nAn investigation into the incident by the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is ongoing.

    "The home side surged to an early lead at Pittodrie when Ryan Christie scored with a header after just four minutes.\nThe Cypriot side grew in confidence and stature in the second half, though, and equalised through Ribeiro Santana.\nYet indiscipline cost the visitors, with Esteban Sachetti dismissed before Shinnie's winner.\nApollon head coach Sofronis Avgousti had already been sent to the stand, just after the Cypriot side equalised.\nIt may have been a rare home European win for the Dons, but given their excellent away form in the Europa League they will be confident of seeing the job through in Larnaca next Thursday night; and they did it without their main hitman.\nOnly Mark McGhee, John Hewitt and Drew Jarvie have scored more European goals for Aberdeen than Adam Rooney, but he may have to wait until the final qualifying round to add the nine he already has.\nThe Irishman had a scan on a hamstring injury the day before the first leg tie and faces a race to be fit not just for the second leg in Cyprus but also the Premiership opener at home to Hamilton on Sunday week.\nEarly on, it didn't look as if the loss of their most prolific striker in recent years would matter that much. Aberdeen started impressively, with a performance of pace, intensity and pressing that Apollon found hard to resist.\nThey were also boosted by an early goal, with Celtic's on-loan midfielder Christie once again the man that mattered after scoring in the home leg against Siroki Brijeg before creating both in the away win in the last round.\nThis time, the midfielder linked up effectively with former Celtic winger Gary Mackay-Steven, looping in a header from the latter's inviting cross from the left.\nGreg Stewart came in for some heavy treatment from Sachetti and the Argentinian midfielder was lucky to escape with only a yellow card for a shocking challenge on the former Dundee striker.\nHowever, to their credit the Cypriot side somehow survived the Dons early onslaught and started to play their way into the game with some neat passing movement that only lacked a cutting edge.\nIt was unsurprising that Christie came closest to increasing Aberdeen's lead before the break with another lovely bit of skill at the edge of penalty area, only to see his shot fly just wide.\nLike the home leg against Siroki Brijeg, though, Aberdeen looked second best for long spells after the break, with substitute Antonio Jakolis causing problems down the right wing, so much so that he created an equaliser.\nThe Croatian burst clear before pulling the ball back for Brazillian left back Jander to force an effort over the line from close range.\nIt looked ominous for Aberdeen at that stage but Avgousti was sent to the stand before the restart and worse was to follow when Sachetti picked up a second yellow card after flattening Christie with 19 minutes remaining.\nThe captain Shinnie rose to the occasion, with a stunning strike right out of the blue from 20 yards that arched its way into the top right-hand corner of the net.",

    "Developing pharmaceutical drugs is a very expensive and time-consuming business. And as AstraZeneca found out last week, disappointing drug trials can knock millions off your stock market value in a flash.\nSo the faster we can identify promising molecules that could be turned into viable drugs, the better.\nThis is why pharmaceutical companies, such as GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), Merck, Sanofi and Johnson & Johnson, are now turning to artificial intelligence (AI) to help them.\nProf Andrew Hopkins is chief executive of Exscientia, an AI-based drug discovery firm that has recently signed a \u00c2\u00a333m deal with GSK.\nHe claims that AI and human beings working together in so-called \"centaur teams\" can help identify candidate molecules in a quarter of the usual time and at a quarter of the cost.\nIn Greek mythology, the centaur was half human, half horse - and very powerful and fast as a result. AI is giving scientists such extra powers, Prof Hopkins believes.\nSuccessful drug discovery relies on precise understanding of how a disease affects our biological systems, says Pamela Spence, global life sciences industry leader at consultancy firm EY.\n\"Once that is known, scientists then search for molecules that can selectively interact with this 'target' and reverse that disruption or slow its impact - a 'hit' molecule,\" she explains.\nScientists often talk of a disease as the target and the molecule as a weapon being fired a it.\nBut this process of drug discovery - traditionally carried out by small teams of scientists painstakingly testing each potential target and hit molecule in the hope of finding a winner - is an enormously time-consuming approach that also has a very high failure rate.\nSo bringing in AI is like having a research assistant who can solve problems by systematic and relentless search at incredible speeds, she says.\n\"What might work - and equally importantly what might not work - can be identified first by the AI supercomputer 'in silico',\" she says.\nThis is the medical term for research carried out by computer, as opposed to \"in vitro\" - think test tubes - and \"in vivo\" - testing on animals and humans.\nAs carrying out human clinical trials accounts for the vast bulk of drug discovery cost, the sooner we can identify when something isn't going to work, the less money will be wasted.\n\"Then the physical testing can be done on a smaller number of potential new medicines... and a much higher success rate can be achieved,\" says Ms Spence.\nExscientia's AI algorithm crunches masses of data, from the structure of diseases to the efficacy of existing drugs, from peer-reviewed studies to observations of slides under a microscope.\nAnd all these possibilities are narrowed down in a process Prof Hopkins likens to natural selection.\n\"We're not trying to rule out the uncertainty - this is messy, dirty data,\" he says. \"There are very interesting analogies between how human creativity works and evolution.\"\nThe aim is to come up with small molecules as candidates for up to 10 disease-related targets that can then be put through clinical tests.\n\"Every pill you make might cost pence to manufacture, but it's actually a precision-engineered product,\" says Prof Hopkins, who is also chair of medicinal informatics at the UK's Dundee University.\n\"There's an almost infinite number of other molecules it could have been. You have to make decisions as to what one might be safe and efficacious,\" he says. \"Most don't lead to anything.\"\nThis AI-driven approach also makes it easier to come up with molecules that can have two distinct targets. For example, a cancer drug could also improve the immune system as well as tackle the disease.\nGSK is getting behind the idea and has recently set up a discovery performance unit focused on enhancing drug discovery through the use of \"in silico\" technology - including AI, machine learning and deep learning.\nThe drive is being led by John Baldoni, GSK's head of R&D.\n\"We have a number of these deals that we are putting in place; the one with Exscientia is probably the one that's furthest along, but we have a few others in flow and a few internal projects ourselves,\" he says.\n\"The cost of discovery from target to launch is roughly $1.7bn [\u00c2\u00a31.3bn]. The cost of what we're talking about here, from target to clinic, is about 33% of that, and it takes about five-and-a-half years.\n\"Our goal is to reduce that to one year, and reduce the cost commensurate with that.\"\nAI is also finding its way into other aspects of the drug discovery process.\nBenevolent AI, for example, uses natural language processing to sift through published literature, such as chemical libraries, medical databases and scientific papers, to draw conclusions about possible new drug candidates.\nEarlier this year, one of its candidates for a drug to treat motor neurone disease - also known as ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) - was found to prevent the death of motor neurones in cells taken from real patients, and delayed the onset of the disease in animals.\n\"We are incredibly encouraged by these findings,\" says Benevolent AI founder and chairman Ken Mulvaney.\nPatients should be encouraged, too. AI-based drug discovery promises to bring more effective, cheaper drugs on to the market much more quickly.",

    "On a visit to Japan, the prime minister welcomed UN condemnation of Pyongyang and said the UK was looking at ways of exerting further pressure on the North Korean regime, including from China.\nMrs May is also aiming to allay Japan's concerns over Brexit and drum up trade.\nShe said Japanese firms continued to make \"important\" investments in the UK as EU withdrawal was being negotiated.\nShe hailed British carmaker Aston Martin's decision to invest \u00c2\u00a3500m in Japan as a sign of the strength of the two countries' economic partnership.\nThe luxury brand announced on Wednesday it would significantly step up its exports to Japan, open a number of new offices next year and expand its dealer network.\nJapan is preoccupied with the issue of North Korea's missile test over its northern Hokkaido island.\nSpeaking to the BBC after arriving for a three day visit, Mrs May urged China to exert its influence over Pyongyang.\n\"I want to work with other international partners to do what we all want to do which is to stop North Korea from conducting these illegal activities,\" she said.\n\"These are illegal tests. It is outrageous, it is provocative and they should be stopped.\"\nThe UK was working to see what \"further pressure\" could be brought on North Korea, including extending sanctions, and the role that China could play in facilitating such action.\nBut asked about the comments, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said the focus should be on de-escalating tensions in the Korean peninsula and \"just chanting about sanctions\" was not the answer.\nMeeting late on Tuesday in New York, the United Nations Security Council called the launch \"outrageous\", demanding North Korea cease all missile testing.\nBut North Korea has signalled plans for more launches, suggesting its firing of a missile over Japan was \"the first step\" of military operations in the Pacific.\nMr Abe greeted his counterpart when she arrived in Kyoto before the two leaders went to a teahouse for a traditional tea-drinking ceremony, followed by a formal dinner at the Kyoto State Guest House.\nThey then took the bullet train to Tokyo, where formal talks will take place on Thursday.\nDowning Street said the two leaders had discussed the Brexit process to date and the UK's position on key issues.\nMrs May, who is being accompanied on the trip by International Trade Secretary Liam Fox and a delegation of business leaders drawn from a range of sectors, told her counterpart that the UK saw Japan's proposed free trade deal with the EU as a \"good basis\" for the beginning of a future UK trading agreement with Japan.\nThe UK is unable to sign any bilateral deals until it has left the EU in 2019.\nJapan has been forthright in expressing concerns about Brexit's impact on its UK-based firms, which employ about 140,000 people.\nMr Abe will be seeking assurances from Theresa May about what kind of relationship the UK will have with the EU post-Brexit and that this will not be detrimental to Japanese businesses with bases in the UK.\nAlthough the UK would be leaving the single market, Mrs May told journalists she had also made clear she wanted to minimise disruption for foreign investors by putting in place transitional arrangements to ensure a \"smooth path\" after the UK leaves in 2019.\nShe added: \"Japan is a longstanding partner of the UK with significant investments in the UK. We have seen Softbank, Toyota investing in the UK since the EU referendum took place.\"\n\"These are important developments for our economy and relationship with Japan.\"\nA special adviser to Mr Abe, Tomohiko Taniguchi, told BBC Radio 4's Today there was uneasiness about Brexit within the Japanese business community but talk of a crisis in relations was over-stated as Japanese firms had an \"inherent preference\" for doing business in Britain.\nNomura bank, Hitachi and carmakers Honda, Nissan and Toyota all have bases in the UK.\nEarlier this year, Nissan said it would build two new models - the new Qashqai and X-Trail - at its Sunderland plant after the government promised that competitiveness would not be damaged by EU withdrawal."
