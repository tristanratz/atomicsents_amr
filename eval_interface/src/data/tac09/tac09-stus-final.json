        "summary": "Since they became separate nations in 1947, India and Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir, the Himalayan province which was split between them.  Kashmir is India's only majority Islam province, and an Islam insurgency began on the Indian side in 1989. More than 45,000 people were killed. A bilateral cease fire was pronounced in 2003, and Prime Minister Singh of India reduced troop levels by 40,000 in a force of 500,000. Peace talks began in 2004 and in March 2005, bus service between the two countries began, the first tangible result of the peace talks.       During November 2004, India's prime minister reduced troops on the Kashmir border as a goodwill gesture prior to his visit. While there, he met with Kashmiri separatist leaders. India rejected a Pakistani suggestion that some Kashmir areas be made independent, placed under joint control, or put under UN administration. The Indian and Pakistani prime ministers were to meet in New Delhi to further the peace process begun in January and facilitated by a year-long ceasefire. Consequently, on April 7, 2005, limited bi-weekly bus service between the Indian- and Pakistani-controlled sections of Kashmir resumed for the first time in 57 years.       A border ceasefire begun November 25, 2003 has held. The US pressured Pakistan to control militant groups. India's early 2004 talks with Kashmiri separatists showed little progress. India and Pakistan were to start formal talks on Kashmir in December. Pakistani President Musharraf suggested making Kashmir autonomous or putting parts under joint India/Pakistan or UN control. Indian PM Singh committed to making peace with Pakistan but rejected redrawing the border. India withdrew some border troops. Singh visited Kashmir three times and announced a Kashmiri economic development plan. Bus service between the Indian and Pakistani zones started in April 2005.       There appears to be progress in the Indian-Pakistani dispute over Kashmir. The bilateral ceasefire has held for a year. The Indian Prime Minister met with Kashmiri political leaders for the first time. India has reduced the number of border troops and announced a multibillion-dollar development plan. Bus service has been opened for the first time in 57 years. The Pakistani President has suggested three solutions: Some areas of Kashmir could be made independent or placed under joint Indian-Pakistani control or put under UN administration. However, India has ruled out division along religious lines or redrawing international borders.",

Musharraf pronounced the peace process, begun in January 2004, as &quot;irreversible.&quot; India and Pakistan agreed to open bank branches in each other's countries. Trade rose to $600 million in 2005, and they pledged improvement in air and shipping services. They also agreed to notify each other in advance of ballistic missile tests. Prime Minister Singh invited Kashmir's separatists for peace talks, a critical move toward pushing forward the peace process. They had previously been excluded from the talks between India and Pakistan.       Despite improved economic and cultural relations, India and Pakistan have made little progress on the problem of Kashmir. However, leaders of both countries remain committed to the peace process. They planned formal talks on the subject in New Delhi on April 17, their first since India's Prime Minister Singh took office last May. On April 16, moderate Kashmiri separatist leaders were to meet with the Pakistani president in New Delhi. In June, they made a historic trip to Pakistan and met with Pakistani government officials. India's Prime Minister Singh invited them for peace talks to be held on September 5.       In April 2005 Musharraf came to New Delhi for an India-Pakistan cricket match and his first talks with Singh. Kashmiri moderates in the All Party Hurriyat Conference (APHC) met with Musharraff there and later visited Pakistan. They demand inclusion in the peace process. Indian mediators had been in contact with APHC leaders since their 2004 talks. Some Kashmiri activists in Indian jails have been freed. Singh invited APHC moderates for peace talks September 5th. Singh and Musharraf met September 14th in NY, vowed to pursue peace in Kashmir but produced no major initiatives. India-Pakistan ties have strengthened in other areas.       Progress continues to be made in the Indian-Pakistani dispute over Kashmir despite the April killing by suspected Muslim rebels of six Indians, including three policemen. The Pakistani President visited India in April for his first formal talks with the Indian Prime Minister. In June eight moderate separatist leaders from India visited Pakistan. In September the Indian Prime Minister invited separatists for peace talks. On the economic front, India and Pakistan were scheduled to hold joint economic meetings for the first time in 16 years. They are focusing on banking, air and shipping services, customs rules, and regular bus service.",

The FDA was supposed to make a decision on the revised OTC proposal in January 2005, but it did not. In February the acting FDA Commissioner was nominated to be Commissioner. He declared the subject of the pill &quot;complex&quot; and could not say when a decision would be made. Some senators refused to vote for confirmation until a decision was announced. As the FDA stalled, debate continued and states began to debate local action and such peripheral issues as whether pharmacists are compelled to sell products to which they have moral objections.       On March 31, 2005, Senate Democrats questioned the nominee for FDA chief on the lack of a decision on over-the-counter (OTC) sales of the morning-after pill, recommended by his staff and available with a prescription since the 1990's. He called the delay complex. Six states already allow OTC sales, with politicians in other states campaigning on this question. Discussions are heating up over pharmacists refusing to dispense this pill, even with a prescription. Four states have laws giving them that right and 11 states are considering this legislation. One pharmacist is suing the Governor of Illinois for this capability.       Several Democratic senators including Kennedy, Clinton, Mikulski, and Murray wanted to delay confirmation of President Bush's nominee to head the FDA until a decision was made on whether the morning-after pill could be sold without prescription. Some pharmacists around the country were refusing to fill prescriptions for any birth control pills, claiming that they violate their beliefs.

Earlier, $20,000, the minimum cost to install a home solar-power system, was too high; but now higher efficiency and tax and rebate incentives from government and utilities help reduce that cost. California has many solar electricity systems already in operation. Interest is widespread. Portugal plans the world's biggest solar energy power station. Taiwan claims the best silicon solar cell plant. Italy has Europe's first solar-powered train.       Spain loaned the Philippines $4.4 million for a solar project to provide electricity to nearly 300 thousand rural households, schools, potable water systems, and health centers. Portugal planned to begin work on the world's biggest solar power station in 2006. The project, built by BP, was expected to create 240 jobs. The California counties of Fresno and Madera operate 500 solar electricity systems and Long Island powers 560 homes and businesses by solar energy. Italy developed a solar power train that powers air conditioning, illumination, and safety systems. Japan and Wales use solar panels for a portion of train power.       Interest in solar power is increasing with large scale projects planned in Portugal and the Philippines. Large energy giants like BP and Royal Dutch Shell are involved in producing equipment. The agricultural valleys of California are considered favorable for solar power. Home conversions to solar power will probably require subsidies to offset initial costs but will lead to low monthly bills. Improvements in semiconductors will aid solar development. Solar panels on trains in Italy and Japan provide for air conditioning, illumination and safety systems. Solar cars and backpacks have been developed.       Expectations are high for the growth of solar power. Petroleum industry officials warn solar could become competitive by 2015. In the US, the solar market is expected to grow by 35% a year. In California, production increased from 10 megawatts in 2001 to 100 in 2005. In New York, demand for home systems skyrocketed this year.

Two months earlier the group had caused a riot when they announced plans for such a rally. More than 30 people were killed in Australia when mobs of drunken white youths attacked people of Middle Eastern appearance at a beach in Sydney. In Wilmington, N.C., a state-appointed Race Riot Commission found that in 1898, violence was part of the successful effort of white supremacists to disenfranchise blacks, some of whom held high public office. An unknown number of black residents were killed.       Swedish authorities are investigating a former KKK leader and US politician for racial law violations after he delivered a speech to a neo-Nazi gathering there. White supremacists are suspected in the killing of a Jewish Defense League activist in a federal prison. Neo-Nazis staged rallied at City Hall in Toledo, Ohio. To avoid violence, about 700 police were deployed, community leaders promised counterdemonstrations would be peaceful, and rally-related activities were confined to City Hall grounds. In a Sydney, Australia, thousands of white youths, including white supremacists and neo-Nazis, attacked Middle Eastern-looking beachgoers. Some 2,000 police were deployed to maintain order.       At least 22 blacks died in Wilmington DE when white supremacists rioted in 1898 and attempted to put members in office by force. Authorities investigated whether David Duke, former Ku Klux Klan leader, violated racism laws in a speech in Sweden, agitating against an ethic group. A neo-Nazi group staged a rally in Toledo OH. Hundred of officers stood guard. More than 30 people were injured and 16 were arrested in racial violence in Sydney Australia in December 2005. The violence began when mobs of drunken white youths attacked people who looked Arabic.       Sweden investigated former Klan leader David Duke for violating its racism laws, punishable by four years in prison, in a speech to neo-Nazis. Toledo police barricaded counter-demonstrators 75 yards from a neo-Nazi rally to avoid a repeated melee. In Sydney, white youths attacked people of Middle Eastern appearance, sparking nights of revenge attacks by carloads of youth. People blocked roads near the local mosque against attack. Heavy police presence and car stops prevented a repeat. White supremacists spent months organizing an 1898 riot and coup d'etat in Wilmington, N.C. that killed blacks, stemmed their political advances, and disfranchised a race.",

Fishermen claim they will disturb tuna migration and force their boats into treacherous waters. A U.S. plan to build 130 turbines in the ocean south of Cape Cod is meeting strong opposition from residents of nearby resorts who say the turbines would spoil the view, disrupt fishing and harm birds.       The first US offshore wind turbine plan was in Nantucket Sound. Opponents of offshore wind power sought a more comprehensive strategy for wind energy and argued it would spoil vacation area aesthetics, disrupt commercial fishing and harm birds and marine life. One study found the proposal would have little effect on the surrounding air, sea, and animal life or fishing conditions. Another study concluded the turbines could alter local weather. Fishermen opposed clusters of windmills on Spain's southern shore because they would disturb tuna migration and necessitate dangerous detours.       Proponents of wind turbine generated power consider it a safe, pollution free, way to reduce dependence on fossil fuels. It counteracts global warming by reducing greenhouse gases and preserves oil and natural gas resources. They contend there is no harm to the local environment and even attract sightseers. Opponents primarily consider wind farms to be a blight on the landscape that lowers property values, tourism and jobs. They expect off shore farms to disrupt commercial shipping, harm birds and marine life, and impact sport and commercial fishing. Land-based farms are deemed to affect local weather, vegetation and wildlife.       Proponents of wind power assert that it is a safe, non-polluting, renewable alternative to fossil fuel.

In 2001, Texas set a U.S. record by installing more wind power capacity than any other state. But recently, 15 states have surpassed Texas's record.

Los Angeles had 15 inches in the first nine days. The rains caused severe flooding, sinkholes and mudslides resulting in huge property losses, blocked roads, power outages, hundreds of auto accidents, interruptions of rail traffic, and, by Jan. 10th, twenty deaths. Heroic efforts by hundreds of overtaxed rescue workers saved thousands from collapsed houses, mud piles and floodwaters. Sensitive listening devices and cadaver dogs searched for signs of life in mountains of mud and debris. By Jan 12th good weather was forecast for later in the week.       Record-breaking rains brought danger and destruction to southern California in the first weeks of 2005. The early January storms dropped more rain in Los Angeles than its average annual amount. Several thousand residents endured power outages. Conditions necessitated widespread evacuations. Landslides, mudslides, floods and downed trees caused massive destruction of homes and roads. Stranded motorists required rescue by overtaxed emergency workers. Schools, businesses, rail lines and roads were closed. Beaches were closed for sewage leaks. The number of traffic accidents tripled from the previous dry weekend. In all, the storms caused at least 20 deaths and dozens of injuries.       Southern California was been drenched by storms beginning in late December 2004, the heaviest drenching in nearly 40 years. Over 15 inches fell during the first nine days of January. The storm resulted in human deaths and injuries. It created flooding, mudslides, and rockslides which caused power outages, evacuations, and disruption of rail services. Beaches, state parks and some mountain and ski resorts were closed. The National Weather Service said this system occurs only every 5-10 years. The extraordinary weather was attributed to a confluence of tropical air from the South Pacific and a cold front from the North.",

        "summary": "Southern California was just recovering from the January 2005 storms in February, when another severe winter storm pummeled the state for six days. Sodden hillsides collapsed, sending some houses sliding down slopes and mud toppling others. The rains killed nine people, destroyed dozens of houses, flooded roads and airports, and cut power for thousands. When the rain stopped, emergency crews began the cleanup, working to clear 20 major roads and fill thousands of potholes, some the size of cars. Engineers assessed whether houses were still habitable. Some ambulance crews were diverted to work spotting signs of flooding and mudslides.       Good weather in Southern California on Jan. 13, 2005 was accompanied by a massive cleanup effort as crews cleared mud, rubble and debris. It had been the wettest 15 days on record. Countless roads were closed, Amtrak service was disrupted and in La Conchita the entire town of 260 people had been evacuated. February 12-23 another rainstorm hit Southern California. Los Angeles had 9.14 inches of rain with a repetition of floods, mudslides, and sinkholes. Six deaths were reported. Los Angeles County estimated the cost of the two storms to its roads and facilities at $52.5 million.       January 13, the rain had stopped and cleanup was underway. Many roads had yet to be cleared. The early January storms claimed 28 lives. A late February storm pummeled southern California for six days. Falling trees, mudslides, rockslides, tornadoes, floods, washed out roads and bridges, and sinkholes threatened residents' safety and homes. At least nine deaths were attributed to this storm, and dozens of homes were condemned. Over 100 were rendered temporarily uninhabitable. Los Angeles opened its Emergency Operations Center to better coordinate its storm response. Damage from the January and February storms could top $100 million.         In the aftermath of the storm that slammed Southern California for six straight days residents faced traffic gridlock and massive amounts of mud, rubble and debris. The Transportation Department hurried to clear major roads. Fire Department and California Highway Patrol employees worked round the clock. It was critical to reopen roads and highways so that people could get back to work. Caltrans estimated it spent $11 million for immediate repairs and would spend $40 million on roads and other public repairs. State officials and farm and insurance groups estimated damage to homes, roads, and farms at over $100 million.",

        "summary": "Although John Yoo is best known for his 2001-2003 Justice Dept. memos, he has actively expressed his views in later years. He offered his opinion on the nominations of Supreme Court Justices. He urged the U.S. to be more ruthless and cunning in the fight against terrorism setting up fake terrorist organizations that would make fake attacks and compete with al-Qaida for recruits. He contends that the U.S. has the right to hold &quot;enemy combatants&quot; indefinitely without charges or lawyers and that the President has the power to unilaterally start a war and overrule the Geneva Convention.       John Yoo recommends the US develop new, ruthless and cunning ways to combat terrorist networks, some of which might run afoul of existing laws. In his new book, Yoo contends the US has the right to hold enemy combatants indefinitely without charges. He believes the constitution gives the president sole power to interpret international law. He believes cruel, inhumane or degrading interrogation techniques fall short of torture and should be employed at the president's discretion with prisoners overseas. Yoo wrote commentary on Supreme Court nominees John Roberts, Harriet Myers and Samuel Alito and on suggested government disaster response improvements.       Yoo helped draft the Patriot Act and a memo narrowly defining torture, and wrote &quot;The Powers of War and Peace&quot;. He thinks the US should be ruthless in disrupting terrorist networks, perhaps setting up false terrorist organizations to sow confusion. He opposes banning secret prisons and harsh interrogations. He advocates extraordinary presidential powers, including making war and interpreting laws. A Federalist Society member, Yoo says Supreme Court nominee John Roberts takes a traditional approach to the law, arguing facts instead of pushing big new theories. Roberts seeks to put biases and feelings aside but doesn't claim he can or should.       John Yoo defines torture as intense &quot;pain accompanying serious physical injury, such as organ failure, impairment of bodily function, or even death.&quot; He claims that &quot;cruel, inhumane, and degrading treatment&quot; is something worse than torture. He thinks the U.S. should be more aggressive in fighting terrorism and find new ways to destroy networks, even assassinating leaders, setting up fake terrorist organizations and deceptive websites, and fabricating attacks on the U.S. He thinks that a judge should argue the facts of his case, not push for new theories and that courts should not make policy on important social issues.",

The king claimed it was necessary to restore peace and democracy in the face of Maoist insurgency. The US, Britain and India who provide aid to Nepal have widely condemned the king's action. UN Secretary General Kofi Annan expressed deep concern and the European Union joined the international condemnation of Gyanendra's action. Japan, another aid donor to Nepal, voiced concern at the power grab. China called the action &quot;an internal affair&quot; and Pakistan adopted the same approach.       Nepali King Gyanendra's power grab added to the regional sense that Nepal is in a downward spiral. The US, UN, EU, India and Britain condemned the move as a setback for democracy.

An appeal in April 2005 by Sinn Fein leader Adams to the IRA to abandon armed struggle was endorsed in May by Irish Prime Minister Ahern. All interested parties awaited a response from the IRA. In late June the U.S. State Department supported British Prime Minister Blair's and Ahern's call for a response. In late July there was a first glimmer of hope as three senior Sinn Fein leaders resigned from the ruling body of IRA's military wing.       Irish PM Ahern said the main goal of the US-brokered Good Friday pact of 1998, a joint Catholic-Protestant administration in Northern Ireland, could be revived only with a complete end of IRA weapons use. The landmark peace deal led to a virtual end of violence in that area. Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams has appealed to IRA members to end their armed struggle in favor of democratic politics. Hopes are rising in Northern Ireland that the IRA will disarm. British PM Blair and Ahern will chair a review of the Northern Ireland situation in London.       The US-brokered Good Friday pact of 1998 ended three decades of violence and created a power-sharing plan in Northern Ireland. It required a complete end to IRA paramilitarism and criminality, and decommissioning of IRA weapons. Power-sharing collapsed in 2002 following continued IRA underground activities. In 2005 Gerry Adams, leader of Catholic Sinn Fein, appealed to IRA members to give up violence in favor of democratic methods, followed by similar appeals by Irish PM Bertie Ahern and Protestant party leader Ian Paisley. Adams, Martin McGuinness and Martin Ferris resigned from the IRA paramilitary council, severing its political and military wings.       The 1998 Good Friday Peace accord had proposed a joint Catholic-Protestant administration, including the Sinn Fein, for Northern Ireland. Although ending decades of fighting, power sharing collapsed in 2002 because of the Irish Republican Army's (IRA) - the military arm of the Sinn Fein - activities and failure to disarm. In 2005, British and Irish leaders sought to restore the power sharing institutions. Protestants insisted the IRA disband and disarm. Protestant leaders was urged to come onboard the peace process. On August 23, three Sinn Fein leaders resigned from leadership positions in the IRA, severing their military ties.",

        "summary": "On July 26 Ireland's deputy prime minister predicted news of a response from the IRA later in the week. The next day senior figures in Sinn Fein departed for the U.S. signaling a forthcoming announcement. An Irish government spokesman warned that an IRA commitment to non-violence had to be backed by an unambiguous process for disposing of all of its weapons. On July 29 the long-awaited statement arrived declaring that &quot;All IRA units have been ordered to dump arms.&quot; U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan hailed the announcement while British Prime Minister Blair called it a &quot;very positive&quot; statement.       IRA has reportedly renounced its armed struggle for a united Ireland. The disposal of IRA arms remains unclear. Adams did confirm that the Roman Catholic paramilitary group was on the verge of making a significant statement. Ahern remained cautious and Northern Ireland Protestant leader Ian Paisley requires absolute proof. UN Secretary General Kofi Annan hailed the decision and Blair called the statement very positive. The IRA pledge to lay down its arms and adopt peaceful means to end British rule in Northern Ireland took effect at 4:00 PM on July 28.       American businessman Niall O'Dowd brokered IRA-US talks leading to a 1994 cease-fire. The 1998 accord established Northern Ireland's local government. In December 2004 Sinn Fein rejected Protestant demands that IRA arms destruction be photographed, halting political progress. Following Gerry Adams' April 2005 appeal to lay down arms the IRA consulted with members. Sinn Fein leaders visited the US but entry was denied to fugitive Rita O'Hare. In July the IRA declared an end to violence. It ordered all its units to dump arms, inviting Protestant and Catholic clergymen to serve as witnesses. The IRA refused to disband as Protestants demanded.       In late August, the IRA ordered an end to its armed campaign in Northern Ireland, declaring there is an alternate way to achieve a united Ireland, free from British rule. If this pledge holds, it will be a historic turning point in the violent history of Ireland and Northern Ireland. The majority Protestant party is expected to demand a one year delay in power sharing. Other remaining questions are will the IRA end criminal operations, will the Catholics support the new police, and will the promised destruction of the massive IRA weapons stash occur. World leaders praised the IRA order.",

        "summary": "In October 2004, Sri Lanka's Tamil Tiger rebel group blamed the government for delay in reviving negotiations to end the conflict that had claimed 60,000 lives since 1972. The rebels themselves suspended talks in April 2003 when internecine struggles broke out between rebel groups. The government claims the Tigers are holding up negotiations and accuses them of killing over 250 of their political rivals since the truce of 2002 went into effect. The government released ten Tamil Tigers from jail on bail, and the rebels responded by freeing two homeguards who had been held hostage since August.       Negotiations under the Norwegian-sponsored peace process of February 2002 between The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and the government of Sri Lanka were at a standstill in October 2004 due in part to internecine struggles within the LTTE. The main LTTE in northern Sri Lanka was challenged by a faction in the east with a leader known as Karuma who broke ranks in March 2004. While LTTE sought support in Europe and Japan offered help in resumption of negotiations, Sri Lanka blamed LTTE for breakdown of the peace process which has been stalled since April 2003.       A group from the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam met in Switzerland to prepare for talks with the Sri Lankan government. A cease in that country brokered by Norway has been observed since February 2002; however, internecine clashes between the LTTE and rival groups counter efforts to revive negotiations between the government and the LTTE. The Sri Lankan government has sent counterproposals to the Interim Self Government to those put forward by the LTTE. Violence continues and a Swiss national was killed. Japanese envoy Akashi was to arrive in Sri Lanka to push for resumption of talks.       Efforts to revive talks between the Sri Lankan government and the Tamil Tiger rebels have been stalled by persistent clashes between rival rebel groups and by continued killings. In early October the top rebel group was in Switzerland to prepare for the next round of talks, while the government said that it had finalized a set of counter proposals for the resumption of direct negotiations. Japan's special envoy arrived in Sri Lanka on 27 October for a 7-day visit to encourage an early resumption of peace talks. Japan is optimistic and has promised continued assistance for the country's reconstruction.",

The Tigers insisted they had not given up their right to secede, although they agreed to explore federal solutions. Increasing violence preceding the visit of the Norwegian foreign minister forced the government to heighten security measures. The Tigers blamed the violence on elements who wanted to discredit them. In November, the government accused Tamil Tigers of breaking a Norwegian-arranged ceasefire by killing a government soldier and a military informant.       A special Japanese envoy met with the Sri Lankan government 27-30 Oct. and on Nov. 1 left for the north for talks with LTTE. Norwegian Foreign Minister Petersen, preceded by violence and increased security, arrived in Colombo on Nov. 9 in a fresh attempt to revive peace talks. Petersen said he did not have &quot;high expectations.&quot; LTTE announced on Nov. 16 that it was prepared to start peace talks on the basis of its proposed Self-Governing Authority. Petersen's lack of &quot;high expectations&quot; was borne out by outbreaks of violence in eastern Sri Lanka Nov. 17-22.       Japanese envoy Akashi ended talks with the government and awaits meeting with LTTE leaders hoping to salvage the peace process. Japan is Sri Lanka's largest donor and supports the Norwegian-backed peace process.

Japan planned to deport him to the U.S., where he was wanted for ignoring sanctions against Yugoslavia. It meant 10 years in jail. Iceland intervened, and Japan agreed not to deport Fischer if Iceland would give him citizenship. Iceland furnished him a special passport and residency permit. Japan insisted on full citizenship, which was finally granted. Iceland revered Fischer because it was there that he defeated Boris Spassky, the Russian chess champion, in 1972, during the cold war.       Bobby Fischer, held in detention in Japan in March 2005 awaiting deportation to the U.S., could achieve asylum in Iceland if granted Icelandic citizenship. He was given residency status, but Iceland's parliament had rejected citizenship in February. Several Icelandic politicians indicated on March 16 that parliament was likely to grant citizenship. A parliamentary committee which reached no decision on March 17 saying they were awaiting more documents from Japan, voted in favor of citizenship on March 18. On March 21 parliament voted in favor 40-0 with two abstentions and 21 absent.       Chess legend Bobby Fischer has been held in detention in Japan for eight months after trying to leave Tokyo on a revoked US passport. He faces deportation and prison in the US for violating sanctions on the former Yugoslavia by playing there in 1992. Supporters worked to secure his passage to Iceland, where he is revered as a national hero for beating Boris Spassky there in 1972. Iceland's parliament granted Fischer a foreigner's passport and a residency permit. But, that was not enough. After receiving assurance that Icelandic citizenship would enable Japan to free Fischer, parliament granted it to him.       Bobby Fischer can avoid deportation from Japan to the US if Iceland upgrades its granting residency to full citizenship. Fischer is popular in Iceland where he beat the Soviet Union's Boris Spassky to become world chess champ in 1972. Fischer faces charges in the US for violating sanctions imposed on the former Yugoslavia for playing there in 1992, and possibly for tax evasion. Fischer wants to marry the head of Japan's chess association. Since leaving the US, Fischer has ranted against the US and Jews. The Icelandic Parliament has granted citizenship to Fischer where he is expected to reside.",

        "summary": "In March, 2005, when Iceland granted citizenship to Bobby Fischer, allowing him to escape extradition to the U.S. from a Japanese prison, a Japanese official said there was no reason to hold him longer. Supporters said he had lost weight and grown a long beard during his eight months in prison. U.S. officials prepared to file tax evasion charges against Fischer, who had not paid taxes on the $3 million he won playing chess in Yugoslavia in 1972. Fischer had renounced U.S. citizenship, but they noted that did not allow citizens to escape prosecution for crimes in the U.S.       On March 22 the Japanese justice minister said it was legally possible to send Fischer to Iceland if he obtained citizenship. Fischer's lawyer expected him to be released within the week. Citizenship still required the signature of Iceland's president. The U.S. State Department expressed disappointment over Iceland's parliamentary action. As of March 23 U.S. officials were preparing tax-evasion charges against Fischer which might render him extraditable from Iceland. The same day (Wednesday) Iceland's ambassador to Japan said Iceland had forwarded documents to Japan confirming Fischer's Icelandic citizenship and hoped to give Fischer a passport before the weekend.       Iceland's granting of citizenship to Bobby Fischer, formally signed into law on March 22, made it legally possible for Japan to deport him to that country. Japanese law only permits deportation to a country where a person is a citizen. Fischer's Icelandic passport was expected to be ready on March 23. Japanese officials agreed to allow him to travel to Iceland after he withdraws his pending lawsuit against the Japanese government to block his deportation. A Fischer supporter said he would do so on the morning of March 24 on his way to the airport to fly to Iceland.       Japan may allow Fischer to go to Iceland where he now holds citizenship if he withdraws a lawsuit against the government to block his deportation. His Icelandic citizenship still requires the president's signature but that appears assured. Fischer has been in Japanese prison for six months including time in solitary for a tussle with guards. Fischer renounced US citizenship but not through proper process so he remains a US citizen said the State Department. He is a fugitive from justice and there is federal warrant for his arrest. His alleged violation of US sanctions is not considered extraditable by Japan.",

She was turned away while trying to protest the Iraq War at the Pentagon and although she spoke out across the nation it was her roadside vigil near President Bush's Texas ranch that gained the attention of the nation and the world. Beginning on Aug. 6, 2005 she vowed to maintain the vigil until Bush spoke with her or finished his August vacation. By August 11 neither Bush nor Sheehan had given in.       Following her son's April 2004 death in Iraq, Cindy Sheehan has made regular public appearances across the nation protesting the war. She co-founded Gold Star Families for Peace. On August 8, 2005, Sheehan led an antiwar protest down the road leading to President Bush's ranch near Crawford, Texas. She and about 50 antiwar activists established a roadside camp not far from the ranch, vowing to remain until Bush met with her. She used the internet to garner publicity. By August 11, several dozen protesters from across the country had joined Sheehan at Camp Casey, named for her fallen son.       When her son was killed in Iraq Cindy Sheehan launched an anti-war campaign. She made public appearances to oppose the war and founded the anti-war group, Gold Star Families for Peace. She received support from anti-war groups in Washington and spoke with Democratic Congressmen. She traveled to Texas with anti-war activists to seek a meeting with President Bush at his Ranch. She was denied a meeting and camped near the Bush ranch, saying she would remain there until Bush met with her. Leading anti-war activists joined her protest in Texas and she received liberal Internet support.       After her son died in Iraq, Cindy Sheehan began protesting the war. She founded the Gold Star Families for Peace and began making appearances and leading protests around the country. On August 6, 2005, she led protestors to Crawford, Texas, demanding to meet with the President. Two officials met with her, but she set up a vigil and swore to continue until Bush personally met with her, even if she had to go to Washington. This protest drew world-wide media attention and garnered support from other anti-war activists. She took her protest to the internet with a conference with bloggers.",

        "summary": "By Aug. 13 Sheehan's group of about a half-dozen activists had grown to about 300 including reporters and confronted by about 100 Bush supporters. The drainage-ditch roadside encampment, dubbed Camp Casey after Sheehan's son, was crowded and caused traffic congestion. On August 16 Sheehan announced that a neighbor had offered a spacious field about one mile from Bush's ranch to accommodate Camp Casey. Sheehan promised to remain encamped there throughout Bush's 5-weeek stay and to return whenever he does. She also announced a series of 1,000 candlelight vigils nationwide on Aug. 17.       Over 100 protesters have joined Sheehan's roadside camp. On August 13, over 350 rallied at the site, undaunted by an earlier counter rally across the road. Sheehan vows to remain through Bush's August vacation, unless he meets with her. To get her message out, Sheehan has received aid from public relations and political operatives and a television spot. As local residents have grown irritated by the stream of protesters, Sheehan announced plans to move the camp to a field offered by one of Bush's neighbors. They plan to complete the move before a dusk candlelight vigil on August 17.       Six days after Cindy Sheehan arrived in Texas more than 350 protestors, including members of Code Pink and True Majority, and over 100 people supporting President Bush had converged on Camp Casey, Sheehan's Texas encampment. Sheehan continued her protests and received support from liberal groups. She announced plans for 1000 candlelight protest vigils nationwide. Sheehan stated she would continue her anti-war activities for the duration of Bush's vacation unless he met with her. Sheehan was savvy in using the media for her cause. She sought to embarrass the President as a strategy to advance her political objective.       Cindy Sheehan is receiving more support as her vigil continues. The number of protestors rose to 350 and the pro-Bush contingent reached 250, creating parking problems and traffic jams. The road encampment included 100's of white crosses representing those killed in Iraq. Someone knocked over many of these crosses, drawing outrage. On August 17, the protestors began moving to land provided by one of Bush's neighbors, where they will have more parking available. Nearly 1,000 candlelight vigils were planned to occur nationwide that evening. Sheehan also is getting public relations advice and is refusing to pay her taxes.",

        "summary": "On March 2, 2005 the Supreme Court faced the issue of whether display of the Ten Commandments (T.C.) at government buildings violates the principle of separation of church and state. Two cases from Texas and Kentucky raised several questions. Are the T.C. a religious statement, a part of legal history, or both? If courts and legislatures can call for God's help in invocations, what's wrong with displaying the T.C.? Does the appearance of the T.C. among other statuary constitute an endorsement? From justices' questions and remarks a split decision seemed likely.       On March 2, 2005, the Supreme Court heard two cases concerning the display of the Ten Commandments on government property. In Texas, a homeless former lawyer challenged the constitutionality of an inscribed monument displayed on state capitol grounds. In Kentucky, the ACLU claimed copies displayed in two courthouses, modified twice before in response to court rulings, still violated the First Amendment because the original purpose was religious and the modifications were a sham. Supporters argued that the Ten Commandments are a recognized symbol of law, with both secular and religious functions. The justices will issue an opinion by late June.       A homeless man, Thomas Van Orden, in Texas is challenging the constitutionality of a monument inscribed with the Ten Commandments and two stars of David on the Capitol grounds. A Kentucky case involves the constitutionality of Ten Commandments displays in two county courthouses. Opponents of the displays argue the displays violate the First Amendments prohibition on establishing an official state religion. Supporters argue the Ten Commandments serve a secular historic function as well as a religious one. The Bush administration has argued on behalf of the displays. Questioning by justices during hearings suggests they are headed for a split decision.       The Supreme Court heard arguments in two cases on March 2nd about the conditions under which the government could display the Ten Commandments and whether such displays violated the First Amendment. The Texas case concerns a 40-year-old granite monument of the Ten Commandments, one of 17 monuments on the grounds of the state capital. The Kansas case concerns framed copies of the Ten Commandments which hang with non-religious documents in two county courthouses. The displays have been modified twice in response to lower court rulings. Justice O'Connor is expected to cast the swing votes.",

        "summary": "On June 27, 2005 the Supreme Court, in a pair of 5-4 rulings, found that the display of the Ten Commandments (T.C.) in a park at the Texas State Capitol was proper, but the displays in the County Courthouses in Kentucky were so overtly religious as to be impermissible. The rulings made it clear that such disputes must be decided case by case with specific facts determining whether there is a violation of the Establishment Clause. Justice Breyer was the swing vote as the only justice voting with the majority in both cases.       While hearing arguments, Supreme Court justices seemed to grapple for a standard which would keep the government from endorsing a religion without eradicating America's historical and cultural ties to religion. On June 27, the court ruled that displaying the Ten Commandments on government property does not necessarily violate the constitutional principle of separation between church and state. They ruled that the monument displayed at the Texas Capitol, one of thousands donated across the country and displayed along with 16 other secular sculptures, was proper. However, they ruled that the courthouse displays in Kentucky were overtly religious and therefore impermissible.       The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the display of the Ten Commandments on Texas Capitol grounds did not violate constitutional principles. Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote for the court and was joined by Justices Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas and Breyer. Justices O'Connor, Stevens, Souter and Ginsburg dissented. In the Kentucky case, the prevailing opinion was that the Commandments display in two county courthouses was overtly religious and thus impermissible. Justice Souter wrote the opinion and was joined by Justices Stevens, O'Connor, Ginsburg and Breyer. The rulings conveyed the message that disputes over religious displays must be decided on a case by case.       The Supreme Court made two separate 5-4 decisions regarding displays of the Ten Commandments, leaving the issue to be decided on a case-by-case basis. Justice Breyer cast the critical swing vote in both cases. The Court ruled that the Texas display was constitutional because it was one of 17 monuments, it had historical as well as religious significance, and it had been there for over 40 years without challenge. In contrast, in Kentucky the Commandments were initially displayed alone; the accompanying historical documents were added in response to a lawsuit, seemingly to hide a religious motivation.",

        "summary": "In the night of October 7, 2004, suspected terrorist car bombs ripped through three Egyptian Red Sea resorts popular with vacationing Israelis. At least 30 people were killed and at least 100 were wounded. Last month, Israeli intelligence warned Israelis to keep out of the Sinai desert, citing information about possible attacks. The explosions came amid a massive Israeli army offensive in the north of the Gaza Strip. The previously unheard of World Islamist Group claimed responsibility for the Taba Hilton Hotel blast, saying it was in revenge for Palestinians and Arabs killed in Palestine and Iraq.       Explosions rocked three Egyptian Red Sea resorts popular with Israelis. The largest explosion occurred in the Taba Hilton just across the Israeli border and the other two in nearby villages. The explosions followed warnings from Israeli Intelligence to keep out of the Sinai Desert. It is not clear how many were killed and wounded in the blasts. Several conflicting casualty numbers were reported. There were no official reports about the cause of the blasts, but police believe they were caused by car bombs. The World Islamic Group claimed responsibility for the Taba explosion but it cannot be verified.       Three explosions shook Egyptian resorts popular with vacationing Israelis. At least 35 people were killed and 100 wounded. Initially reported as a gas leak, the largest explosion may have been a truck bomb driven into the Taba Hilton across the border from the Israeli resort town of Eilat. Two other explosions took place to the southwest at Ras al-Sultan and Nuweiba. At least seven died at the former, most Egyptian workers. A previously unknown group, Jamaa Al-Islamiya Al-Alamiya claimed responsibility for the Taba Hilton bombing. Shin Bet intelligence service had advised Israelis not to go Sinai resorts during holidays.       In October 2004, three terrorist car bombs shook Egyptian Red Sea resorts popular with vacationing Israelis, killing 35 (including 23 Israelis) and wounding 125. A powerful car bomb close to the entrance of the Taba Hilton destroyed much of the hotel. Two hours later two vans exploded at tourist camps in Ras Satan (Ras al-Sultan) and Nueiba. Seven died at Ras al-Sultan, mostly Egyptian workers. The previously unknown World Islamist Group claimed responsibility. The attack occurred Thursday night at the close of the Jewish holiday of Sukkot, amid an Israeli offensive in the Gaza Strip that left 93 Palestinians dead.",

        "summary": "Israeli officials strongly suspect the al-Qaida network in the three Sinai Peninsula resort blasts based on similarities with past attacks. Another previously unknown group, Islamic Unity Brigades, claimed responsibility for the series of bombings, supposedly as revenge for Israel's assassination of Hamas founder Sheikh Ahmed Yassin in March. Both a car bomb and a suicide bomber struck the Taba Hilton at about 10:00 p.m. Car bombs are suspected in the blasts which struck just before midnight at the Ras Shytan and Nuweiba resorts. Accounts of the dead and wounded varied throughout the rescue effort.       After the explosion many Israelis immediately fled across the border. The Egyptians facilitated the evacuation. Egyptian authorities cooperated with Israeli fire and rescue personnel, allowing ambulances to cross the border to evacuate the wounded and search for those trapped in the debris. Two groups, one calling itself the Islamic Unity Brigade and a previously unknown pro-Al Qaeda Islamic group called Islamic Tawhid Brigades, claimed responsibility for the bombings. Neither group offered details of how it carried out the attack. Their claims could not be verified. Israel's deputy defense minister believed Al Qaeda terrorist network was involved.       The massive explosion at Taba killed at least 30 and injured more than 100 in a terrorist attack aimed at Israeli tourists. Israel blamed al-Qaida but a group called &quot;Islamic Unity Brigades&quot; claimed responsibility. Israeli officials speculated that the militants were finding it difficult to attack Israelis in Israel and were choosing to attack them abroad. The attacks may also be intended to damage Egypt's tourism industry. Two blasts in quick succession had collapsed a ten story wing of the luxury Taba Hilton hotel. More than 100 rescue workers were allowed to enter the damaged area.       On Sept. 9th Israel advised Israeli tourists to avoid the Sinai, citing a concrete threat. In early October al-Qaeda deputy Zawahiri called on Muslims to attack Israeli, Western and Asian interests everywhere, specifically Egypt. A second previously unknown group, &quot;Islamic Unity Brigades&quot;, claimed credit. Possibly an Egyptian radical group was to blame. Israel blames al-Qaida, noting similarities with previous attacks, specifically multiple simultaneous strikes. The camp blasts were five seconds apart. One or more suicide bombers were involved in the Hilton attack. One car drove into the hotel lobby and detonated at 10pm. Another blew up nearby causing no casualties.",

Thursday's attacks killed at least 19 and included a car bombing near Samarra and three blasts in Basra. Forty-five polling stations were attacked across Iraq on Friday. At least six were killed. Attacks occurred around Kirkuk, Baghdad, Al-Dur, Tikrit, and Shorgat. On Saturday, several polling stations were struck, but no large-scale insurgent offensive materialized. A suicide bomber of al-Zarqawi's al-Qaida network attacked a station in Khanaqin. Other attacks occurred in Baghdad, Ramadi, Kirkuk, Baiji, and Moqdadiya. At least 18 were killed on Saturday.       Three days before Sunday's election, 40 polling stations were already destroyed. Most were empty and casualties were low. Polling station attacks escalated Thursday through Saturday but no large-scale offensive materialized. Violence was concentrated in the Sunni heartland. Polling stations were attacked with homemade bombs, car bombs, mortars, rocket-propelled grenades, and small arms fire. Two police guards were shot dead. The worst attacks were a car bomb in Samarra that hit a nearby Iraqi army patrol, killing seven; and a Zarqawi-connected suicide bomber who approached a Khanaqin polling station and set off a blast that killed eight, including three soldiers.       In the days leading up to the January 30, 2005 elections in Iraq, more than 100 of the more than 5,000 polling places across the nation were attacked, with many of those destroyed. Although 400 Iraqi were reportedly killed in January as part of the anti-election campaign, casualties at the polling places were limited because many were empty. The attacks ranged from car-suicide bombers, to small bombs, mortars and bullets, to posters and pamphlets. The threats to the polling places came from guerilla and militant groups, to include Al-Qaeda and mujahedeen factions. They promised more violence on election day.       Despite heavy security measures, scores of attacks targeted Iraqi polling places throughout the country in the days preceding the Sunday January 30 Iraqi elections, with some 40 polling stations destroyed. Casualties, including Iraqi policemen, soldiers, a child, and a woman, were low because most of the buildings were not occupied. The attacks struck polling places in Baghdad, Tikrit, Samarra, Basra, Kirkuk, Al-Dur, Baiji, Shorgat, and Moqdadiya. Violence is expected to escalate on Sunday and continue after the elections. Many Sunnis are expected to boycott the elections, but a high turnout is expected among Shiites and Kurds.",

A mortar attack killed four and wounded seven in the Shiite slum of Sadr City. In Basra, a mortar exploded, but no casualties were reported. Balad suffered two mortar attacks. One voter was killed, and a child wounded. In sharp contrast, no one went to vote in Fallujah. Most people said they were afraid. In the past days, insurgents have targeted the polling centers in Anbar province, where Fallujah is situated.       On Sunday, attacks on polling places began shortly after polls opened and took six lives. A suicide car bomber detonated an explosives belt in Baghdad?s upmarket Mansur district, killing a policeman and injuring four, including two Iraqi soldiers. A string of explosions and machine gun fire was heard in the center of the city after the bombing. In Sadr City a mortar killed four voters and wounded seven others. A mortar shell landed near a Basra polling place. A wave of blasts believed to be mortar fire jolted Baqouba. Two mortar attacks killed a voter and wounded two in Balad.       Despite heavy security, Iraq's election day opened with a suicide car-bomber hitting a polling place in western Baghdad causing four casualties. A mortar hit a polling place in the Baghdad slum of Sadr City, causing 13 casualties. Two polling stations in Balad sustained mortar attacks, killing one and injuring two. In Basra, a blast hit a school that was serving as a polling station, with no casualties reported. Sporadic explosions and gun fire were reported in Baghdad, Mosul, and Baquba through the day.       Six people died in the Sunday January 30 Iraqi elections, despite heavy Iraqi security around polling places. Many Iraqis defied the insurgents' threats of attacks in order to vote; however, there was little or no turn-out in Fallujah and Samarra because of the security situation. The most serious attacks were in Baghdad, where five people including a policeman were killed, along with the suicide bomber, and in Balad, where a woman was killed. There were also attacks in Basra and Mosul but no casualties were reported.",

New rules on voting provided that the required 2/3 majority of cardinals would revert to a single majority if no decision had been reached after several days. On the morning of April 18, 2005, Cardinal Ratzinger, a prominent contender for pope, delivered a homily strongly endorsing orthodoxy. That afternoon, after the first voting session, a signal of white smoke from The Sistine Chapel roof, which would indicate election of a pope, turned to black, showing that no decision had been made.       On Sunday, April 17, 115 Roman Catholic cardinals representing 52 countries and six continents arrived at the Vatican to select a successor to Pope John Paul II. On Monday, they convened a conclave, a secret and sacred gathering, in the Sistine Chapel. Following the cardinals' oath, the selection process began. A two-thirds majority is required to elect a pope. Outside, attention was focused on the chapel roof, watching for the white smoke of burning ballots that would indicate a successful election. Monday, black smoke rose from the chimney. The cardinals would return twice daily, beginning Tuesday, for additional ballots.       The conclave was introduced to inconvenience cardinals and thus speed up the process. Today it helps preserve secrecy. The opening pageant is televised, then all news media and audiovisual or communication equipment is banned. Cardinals move into St. Martha's House and are forbidden to talk to anyone not sworn to secrecy. In 1996 John Paul II instituted new rules concerning choosing a pope. Until a two-thirds majority is reached the pattern is seven ballots and a day of rest. If a deadlock remains after 12 days, voting may resort to simple majority. Bells will ring when a pope is elected.       On April 18, 2005, 115 cardinals, all under 80, were sequestered in the Vatican to elect a new pope. After a televised mass, they took an oath of secrecy, then moved to the Sistine Chapel, which had been swept for bugs and contained electronic jammers. They meet twice a day, voting twice each session, until one man receives a 2/3's majority. After each vote the ballots are burned - black smoke signals no one was elected. When a pope is chosen, white smoke will be accompanied by bells. Pilgrims in St. Peter's Square watched the first ballot's black smoke.",

        "summary": "Although many said there was no clear front-runner among the 115 cardinals, Ratzinger's sermon at the pre-conclave mass put him in the limelight for conservatives. On April 19th white smoke rising from the chapel roof at 5:15 p.m. stayed white. Ratzinger had been chosen after four ballots. His victory was cheered widely as an extension of the legacy of John Paul II, but questioned by more liberal elements concerned by a sharply divided church. There was hope in the new pope's explanation that he would be Benedict XVI after Benedict XV who gave himself to &quot;peacemaking, reconciliation and harmony.&quot;       On Tuesday, April 19, white smoke puffed from the Sistine Chapel chimney, signaling the election of a new pope. After four ballots, Roman Catholic cardinals elected German-born Joseph Ratzinger, a renowned theologian and hard-line enforcer of Catholic Church doctrine. Ratzinger took the name Pope Benedict XVI.       In the 13th century cardinals spent more time hunting and feasting than seriously deliberating, so in 1271 a mob tore the roof off their meeting place, exposing them to the elements, and gave them only bread and water to force a decision. Now cardinals are locked up until they decide. Previously, conclaves were held in the town where the last pope died. Smoke became the logical means of signaling a decision because ballots needed to be burned. After John Paul II's death the Vatican stipulated that special chemicals be added to the smoke and bells be rung to avoid confusion.       In April 19, the new pope was elected on the fourth ballot, signaled by the white smoke and tolling bells. Following the election, Joseph Ratzinger accepted and announced his papal name, Benedict XVI. He was then taken to a dressing chamber nicknamed the &quot;Room of Tears&quot;, where he donned the papal vestments. A Chilean cardinal then proclaimed &quot;We have a pope!&quot; from the central balcony over St. Peter's Square where thousands of pilgrims were gathering. Pope Benedict then appeared and made a brief speech. The electing cardinals were on surrounding balconies.",

        "summary": "Betty Friedan was a brilliant, visionary woman who came to prominence in 1963 with publication of her book, The Feminine Mystique. The wildly popular book brought about a re-examination of women's role in society. Friedan found that many women were not content with lives of domesticity, and she campaigned for greater access to work outside the home. She was the first president of the National Organization for Women and a leader in the drive to pass the Equal Rights Amendment. She was abrasive, and some feminists criticized her for ignoring concerns of women of color, lesbians and the poor.       In 1963 Betty Friedan wrote a provocative book, The Feminine Mystique, that ignited the feminist movement. The book exposed American women's discontent with domesticity and workplace discrimination. Friedan started an international movement. She founded and was elected president of NOW. She helped found the National Women's Political Caucus and a group that later became NARAL. For two decades she led demonstrations, protest marches, and news conferences. Her moderate belief that women should have equal rights but not at the expense of alienating men caused a split with other feminist leaders and her relegation to the sidelines in the late 1970's.       Betty Friedan's 1963 controversial bestseller &quot;The Feminine Mystique&quot; made her the leading spokeswoman for a revitalized women's movement. Her pioneering book identified the unhappiness of post-WWII American women unfulfilled by traditional domesticity. She was an advocate of the Equal Rights Amendment and pushed for legal abortion. She helped found the National Organization for Women in 1966 and was its first president, splitting with them over their emphasis on lesbian issues and alienating men. She led the 1970 500,000-person Women's Strike for Equality. She was a founder of the Women's Political Caucus and NARAL. She wrote &quot;The Second Stage&quot; in 1981.       Betty Friedan's 1963 classic &quot;The Feminine Mystique&quot; started a social revolution that led to the modern women's movement. It was included in Human Events magazine's list of the &quot;Ten Most Harmful Books of the 19th and 20th centuries.&quot; Frieden helped found the National Organization for Women in 1966 and was one of the founders of the National Women's Political Caucus. In 1970, she led a 500,000-person Women's Strike for Equality down Fifth Avenue. Friedan pushed for equal pay, sex-neutral help-wanted ads, maternity leave, child-care centers for working parents, and other topics considered radical at the time.",

        "summary": "The feminist movement split, and Betty Friedan, who helped to start it, was sidelined. She resigned as the first president of the National Organization for Women after only a few years, as other women radicalized the movement. When she died at age 85 in 2006, newspapers had to remind readers that before Betty Friedan and the work of the movement she helped to start, equal pay for equal work, sex-blind help-wanted ads, the right of pregnant women to keep their jobs, non-discriminatory admissions standards for professional schools and many other matters were considered not only controversial, but radical proposals.       Betty Friedan helped to empower women to fight for parity with men in the workplace, equal jobs, pay and respect. She encouraged them to reject the &quot;contented homemaker&quot; role and demand fuller participation in life. Some considered her the most influential woman of the second millennium. She raised issues such as paid maternity leave, affordable childcare, job training for women and reproductive self determination, which were radical in the 1960's but are still important today. Some feminists felt she focused too much on the concerns of white middle class married women instead of all women.       Friedan's first cause was unification of help-wanted ads separated by gender. She empowered women to fight for parity with men. She started a revolution, getting women organized and demanding change. Drawing on her own unhappy Midwestern childhood, she voiced the dissatisfaction suburban wives struggled with alone. Friedan made the point that if an entire group has a problem, the solution can't be purely personal. She compared housewives resigned to their situation to inmates in comfortable concentration camps. Friedan was a moderate in the women's rights movement, believing women should have equal rights but not at the expense of alienating men.       Betty Friedan's &quot;The Feminine Mystique&quot; triggered profound changes in American life, changes so basic that most people today find it hard to believe that when the book was published a woman's role was to get married, raise children, keep a clean house, and please her husband; the only careers &quot;acceptable&quot; for women were nursing and teaching; and girls did not compete in sports. The entry of women into the workforce permanently changed the culture and economy, not only in America, but around the world.",

The British Prime minister, Archbishop of Canterbury, Queen Elizabeth, and Prince Charles' sons were pleased over the engagement. Brits reacted more with relief than happiness, viewing it as a logical conclusion to a difficult situation. Camilla will receive the title HRH the duchess of Cornwall. If Charles ascends to the thrown she will become HRH the princess consort. The wedding, a civil service for family and friends, will be followed by a prayer and dedication service. The couple will honeymoon in Scotland.       Ending years of speculation, Prince Charles announced in February that he will marry Camilla Parker Bowles April 8th in a civil service at Windsor Castle. Camilla will be called her royal highness the duchess of Cornwall and later princess consort, rather than Princess of Wales or Queen Camilla. Queen Elizabeth, Charles' two sons, PM Tony Blair, and the Archbishop of Canterbury all approved the marriage. An Act of Parliament will be needed and is expected. Reaction among the population was mixed. The Archbishop will officiate at a prayer and dedication service in the chapel of St. George following the ceremony.       On February 10, 2005, Britain's Prince Charles announced he would wed Camilla Parker Bowles on April 8. The festivities will be a civil ceremony in Windsor Castle, followed by a prayer service, led by the Bishop of Canterbury, in the castle's chapel. The couple chose the title HRH Duchess of Cornwall for Camilla and HRH Princess Consort when Charles becomes king. The Queen, the royal family, and the British Prime Minister supported the announcement. Only an Act of Parliament is still needed. British citizens' reactions were mixed. That evening Camilla displayed her engagement ring at a gala castle dinner.       On February 10th Prince Charles announced that he would marry his long-time love Camilla Parker Bowles. That evening the couple attended a gala dinner at Windsor Castle to support one of the Prince's charities. The wedding will be a private, civil ceremony at Windsor Castle on Friday April 8th. The Archbishop of Canterbury will preside over a subsequent religious service in St. George's Chapel. Parker Bowles will receive the title of her royal highness the Duchess of Cornwall.

In Australia a group that wants to sever ties with the British monarchy reported a surge of new members in reaction to the news.

Later, learning the Koran does not ban music, he traveled to the U.S to cut a record. Making a follow-up trip, he was detained.

He has established Islamic schools in Britain and worked as a peace activist. Recently, he sang at a charity concert in London and recorded a version of one of his hits.

Cat Stevens, a successful singer/songwriter for two decades, abandoned his music career, converted to Islam, and changed his name to Yusuf Islam 30 years ago. He has devoted himself to charity and peace campaigns and to single-faith Islamic schools in Britain, but denies supporting terrorist activities. In September 2004, when Islam was barred from entering the United States because his name appeared on the &quot;no-fly&quot; list of people deemed as security risks, he vowed to find out why he was barred.

Cat Stevens, a British citizen born in 1948, is a singer who had hits in the 1960's and 1970's, selling more than 50 million records. After nearly drowning in 1976, he converted to Islam. He stopped performing, changed his name to Yusuf Islam, and campaigned for peace and charity. He returned to music by 2004. Although he was in the US in May and September, in October he was refused entry for supporting terrorism. Time Magazine reported a Youssouf Islam was the actual terrorist. In November, Yusuf was given the &quot;Man for Peace&quot; award and participated in an AIDS fundraiser.",

The dispute was sparked by Islam's deportation from the U.S. After the 2005 London bombings, Islam said the true meaning of Islam should be taught to Muslim children to discourage extremism. He was founder of the Islamiya Primary School. Islam gave a concert in Jakarta to raise cash for tsunami victims of 2005. He recorded a new song, &quot;Indian Ocean,&quot; in response to the disaster and opened an office of his own charity in Indonesia.       Yusuf Islam, whose birthday is July 21, will host a concert in Jakarta to raise money for tsunami disaster victims. He will perform his song, Indian Ocean, written for the occasion. Proceeds from the song's recording would go to aid tsunami-orphaned children through his charity, Small Kindness. Two British newspapers paid unspecified damages to Islam over articles suggesting he had links to terrorists. Islam said the money would be given to relief projects in areas hit by the December Indian Ocean tsunami. The US government still has not explained why his name was added to the no-fly list.        Yusuf Islam hosted a benefit concert for tsunami relief in Jakarta, Indonesia in January 2005 and recorded the song &quot;Indian Ocean&quot; to provide aid to tsunami orphaned children. His charity Small Kindness set up an office in Indonesia to assist the orphans. Islam said in February 2005 that his work was adversely affected when two British newspapers alleged he had been involved in terrorism. The newspapers apologized, paid his legal fees, and promised not to repeat the allegations. A year after he was barred from entering the US, the government had not revealed its reason for doing so.       In early 2005, Yusuf Islam devoted his time to helping Indonesian victims of the tsunami. He planned to give a concert, release a record, and donate money from two British newspapers. The papers paid unspecified damages for October articles suggesting he had ties to terrorism. In September, Islam spoke at the opening of an Islamic study center at Cardiff University. There he placed some blame for the July 7 bombings on foreign policy, but also called on Muslim schools to keep students from extremist ideas. In 1995, his school in London became the first Islamic school to win public funding.",

One of several searches of locations linked to Jackson seized the top layer of a mattress used in his mansion. A DNA swab from Jackson's mouth was taken the same day. Jury selection for his trial is scheduled for Jan. 31, 2005. During 2004 Jackson asked that the prosecutor be removed, led a protest against rapper Eminem, faced charges of non-payment of bills, and received an e-mail death threat.       Michael Jackson's woes are many since his arrest for child molestation. He's suing XtraJet for videotaping his conversations with his lawyer. There's upheaval in his legal team since he fired two attorneys, hired one, and another took leave. Jackson's attorneys accused District Attorney Tom Sneddon of having a vendetta against him. Prosecutors alleged Jackson plotted to kidnap his accuser. In one week, Jackson was hit with two non-payment lawsuits. A rapper's video mocked Jackson and angered him, and he received a death threat. Investigators launched another search of Neverland Ranch, which frightened his children, and took a DNA sample.         In November 2003 police arrested Michael Jackson on several counts of child molestation after having raided his California ranch. Jackson's attorney accused the District Attorney of having a vendetta against Jackson and alleged in a lawsuit that private conversations used as evidence had been illegally recorded. Jackson had problems with his legal team. Rapper Eminem issued a video showing a Jackson look-alike on a bed with children. A former business associate seeking $3 million sued for breach of contract and a merchant sued to collect nearly $180,000. In December 2003 investigators searched Jackson's ranch and took DNA from his mouth.       Michael Jackson is having a rough time. His long-time attorney Steve Cochran left the defense team for unknown reasons. Eminem made a music video showing a Jackson look-alike in bed with children. He has been sued for three million dollars by a former business associate for breach of contract and for $180,000 by an antique store for unpaid bills. And a Canadian pleaded guilty to emailing a death threat to Jackson. Another search was made of Jackson's Neverland Ranch on 3 December and the following day investigators took DNA samples from Jackson's mouth.",

        "summary": "The Bush administration began an offensive in 2005 to persuade Congress to renew the Patriot Act, parts of which would expire in 2006. That law, passed after September 11, gave broad powers to government agencies to obtain information for fighting terrorism. They argued the Patriot Act has prevented further attacks. A coalition of conservatives and liberals organized to demand changes, believing the Act endangered individual freedom. The groups challenged provisions giving access to library, medical and firearm-ownership records; allowing secret searches; and allowing surveillance of protests. Earlier, a judge disallowed forcing Internet providers to turn over records.       The Patriot Act included major sections that expire in 2005 if not renewed by Congress. The Bush administration calls for complete renewal, but liberals and some conservatives maintain that the law gives the federal government too much power. Bush threatens to veto any congressional weakening of the Act. The specific sections are targeted by an unusual left-right coalition. The sections attacked are: the one permitting easy access to records in terrorism-related cases; the provision for &quot;sneak and peek&quot; secret searches before a warrant is presented; and an overbroad definition of &quot;terrorists&quot; that could include non-terrorist suspects.       Weeks after 911 Congress passed the USA Patriot Act. The Act expanded Federal law enforcement officials' surveillance and prosecution power against suspected terrorists. Key elements of the Act were to expire at the end of 2005. Congress had to decide whether to renew them. The Bush administration argued that the Act had kept America safe and sought to retain all elements. Opponents argued that the Act undermined freedom and gave the federal government too much power. Groups opposed to the renewal of the Act formed a coalition, Patriots to Restore Checks and Balances, to lobby Congress to repeal key provisions.       President Bush, the outgoing Attorney General John Ashcroft and his deputy, James Comfey, have promoted the Patriot Act. The President and incoming Attorney General Gonzales have called for it extension. Ashcroft's speeches promoting of the Act have not violated anti-lobbying rules. The liberal American Civil Liberties Union and conservative libertarian groups have joined forces to oppose giving government access to library and medical records. A US district judge ruled that a provision of the Patriot Act that enabled federal authorities to force Internet service providers to provide subscriber information violated the First and Fourth Amendments.",

The &quot;library provision&quot; that allowed searching of library records, caused five states and 375 communities in 43 states to pass anti-Patriot Act resolutions, the ACLU said. Nevertheless, the Bush administration continued its campaign to preserve the Patriot Act and even to expand it. Congress considered legislation that could enlarge the FBI's ability to wiretap people whom it suspected were security risks. Also, it would lift a restriction on special warrants, that information obtained must be related to terrorism.       Congress began consideration of Patriot Act (PA) renewal on April 4, 2005. By then 5 states and 375 county and city governments had passed resolutions warning of the Act's excesses. Senators Craig (R-ID) and Durbin (D-IL) had drafted The Safety and Freedom Enforcement Act (SAFE) eliminating the three main targets of the civil libertarians. The Administration pushed for making the entire PA permanent. Testimony by the Attorney General and FBI Director opened the debate. By June the Administration's case was made in draft legislation offered by Sen. Roberts (R-KS) further strengthening federal powers and countering SAFE.       Anti-Patriot Act resolutions were adopted in five states and 375 communities. While Congress debated making Patriot Act provisions permanent, there was strong bipartisan support for retaining the &quot;sunset&quot; provisions to ensure Justice Department accountability. Critics of the Patriot Act sought changes to limit the Act in several ways, including informing suspects of &quot;sneak and peek&quot; searches within 7 days unless a judge intervened. The Senate Intelligence Committee met behind closed doors to consider a draft bill that would escalate government police powers. The bill was viewed as a Republican maneuver to shift arguments to expanding the Patriot Act.       Delayed Notification Searches (called sneak and peek) are the central issue regarding extending, modifying or curbing executive powers under the Patriot Act. The Justice Department urges extension. The ACLU and some conservative libertarians call for curbing powers. Five state legislatures and several communities have passed resolutions to limit executive powers. A bill by Senators Durbin and Craig would amend the Act. A draft bill by Senator Roberts Intelligence Committee would extend FBI powers. Gonzales said at one point the search authority had been used 35 times. Later, that figure was given as 155 times as of January 2005.",

Only driver's licenses from complying states will be valid for air travel and other official identification purposes. The law would deny licenses to illegal immigrants and would significantly raise the standard of proof of persecution for asylum-seekers. Proponents expect greater homeland security. Opponents say the law is anti-immigrant and would add cost and delays to DMV processes. Civil libertarians argue it creates a de facto national ID card and threatens individual privacy.       The Real ID Act was attached to a 2005 must-pass Iraq Appropriations bill, bypassing hearings and debate. The Act contains provisions aimed at keeping terrorists from crossing US borders. The most controversial would make it hard for states to issue driver's licenses to illegal immigrants and possibly require a national ID card. States would need to add security features to driver's licenses and create license databases. Most Americans detested the idea. The ACLU tried to stop the bill. Opponents viewed it as a blatant attack on immigrants' rights and did not believe it would improve US security.       House Judiciary Committee Sensenbrenner attached his Real ID Act to a must-pass Iraq appropriations bill. The bill would make it more difficult for states to issue driver's licenses to illegal immigrants and that it would protect against terrorist entry into the US. Civil libertarians oppose the bill on grounds that it would create a de facto national ID card. The measure may run counter to the president's support for a temporary guest worker program. States fear the act would add another unfunded federal mandate on them and create delays at motor vehicle bureaus. Immigrant rights groups oppose the Act.       The Real ID Act was attached to a 2005 Iraq appropriations bill without legislative review. It is intended to stop illegal aliens from having driver's licenses to use to board airplanes and enter public buildings, raise the standard of proof of persecution for asylum seekers, and build a fence on the border near Tijuana, Mexico. Opponents fear the act will create a national ID card; impinge on states' powers; give untrained workers responsibility for immigration control; gridlock the license process; increase unlicensed, uninsured drivers; deny qualified asylum seekers; harm the environment; and cost five times what is expected.",

        "summary": "Mexico's president condemned the Real ID Act, including provisions for the construction of a wall along the common border. Homeland Security waived environmental laws, as the Real ID Act allows, and authorized completion of the border fence. States are finding the financial, logistical and technical demands of the law daunting. A possible unintended effect might be increased unlicensed, uninsured motorists. California opted to offer illegal immigrants separate licenses for driving only, not to be used as official identification. By broadening the definition of terrorist groups, the Real ID Act has complicated the laws regarding refugees resettling in the US.       The Real ID Act, enacted in May 2005, required that in three years states determine whether driver's license applicants are in the country legally. Civil libertarians and immigration rights activists protested the bill. States blasted the bill because it placed a large burden on them and worker training requirements. They believed the Act grossly underestimated financial, logistical and technological demands. Some states need to amend their laws and others need to overhaul their computing systems to verify the accuracy of documents. The bill is expected to be phased in over a 5-year period, beginning in 2008.       The Real ID Act restricts asylum, bans drivers' licenses for illegal aliens and allows for construction of a wall along the Mexican border near San Diego which may cause harm to the Tijuana estuary. Vicente Fox has condemned the measure. An editorial claims that denying licenses to undocumented workers will result in fewer licensed and insured drivers and thus less safety. Real ID has some requirements that would necessitate extensive and costly changes to systems used by some states. California is considering a license valid only for driving and not as id for other purposes.       The Real ID Act, billed as a tool to fight terrorism but appearing as an anti-immigration crusade, became law in May. Governors and motor vehicles officials protested the driver's license portion, citing its impact on their budgets and procedures, as well as the resulting requirements to upgrade computer systems and hire and train employees. California began struggling with issuing unique licenses for illegals. The authorized fence will have severe ecological results. Tens of thousands of refugees were stranded by the act, which denies entry to anyone who helped or was forced to help groups rebelling against even authoritarian regimes.",

Hundreds, possibly thousands of lawsuits were likely to be filed against Merck, lawyers said, including many class action lawsuits, all claiming injury from taking Vioxx. Plaintiffs' cases were strengthened when proof was uncovered that Merck knew about Vioxx's risk but discounted it.       Merck withdrew Vioxx when a study showed it increased the risk of strokes and heart attacks. An FDA study estimates Vioxx may have caused 27,785 attacks/deaths since its approval. The medical community was concerned about use of related drug use and sought more guidance. Lawyers estimated thousands of lawsuits would be filed against Merck. One settlement estimate was $12 billion. Merck's costs to withdraw Vioxx from the market were $552.6 million and their profits for the third quarter of 2004 dropped 29 percent. Several medical reports criticized Merck's failing to stop Vioxx when data first showed its potential danger.       Merck has recalled its popular arthritis medicine Vioxx. Use of Vioxx may increase risk of stroke and heart attack. This is the largest prescription drug recall in history and could lead to an onslaught of lawsuits.

A study by the FDA estimated that Vioxx could have caused 27,785 heart attacks or deaths since its approval in 1999.       The SEC and the Justice Department studied Merck's handling of Vioxx. Merck was unsure whether their insurance would be adequate against lawsuits. Moody's dropped Merck's credit rating because of litigation exposure. A clinical trial of Celebrex, a drug similar to Vioxx, was shut down when researchers found increased risk of heart disease and stroke A Senate Committee heard testimony that Merck and the FDA were aware of the Vioxx risks before the drug was approved. Merck adopted a plan to protect 230 of their top executives in case financial trouble necessitated a takeover.       Merck disputed the British weekly, Lancet, that Vioxx should have been recalled four years earlier. Merck is the subject of a Justice Department criminal investigation and an SEC inquiry. The company's shares slumped on that news. The New York state pension fund filed a lawsuit against Merck. Nearly a year before Merck received results of the clinical trial prompting recall of Vioxx, patient records indicated the drug posed a cardiovascular risk. A drug safety expert at FDA accused the agency of pressing him to withhold a study showing the dangers of Vioxx. Merck has adopted large severance packages for executives.       Regulators and Merck were accused of knowing Vioxx risks pre-approval. An FDA drug reviewer claimed superiors pressed him to withhold study results showing Vioxx risks. Merck confirmed seeing results showing risk one year before Vioxx was pulled. The SEC and Justice Department instituted civil and criminal investigations into Merck's handling of Vioxx. State attorneys general criticized Merck's return and refund program. New York State's pension fund lost $171 million and filed suit against Merck for misleading shareholders. Merck was criticized for offering 230 executives large severance packages. A Celebrex clinical trial was halted after researchers found risks similar to Vioxx's.",

        "summary": "In June 2005, Steve Jobs announced that Apple would switch to Intel chips for some of its Macintosh computers in 2006, all by 2007. IBM, its supplier for 14 years, was unable to deliver its new PC chip that promised more power and less heat, both needed for laptops Apple planned. The move was a gamble for Apple because software developers would have to re-engineer all programs for Intel chips. Intel celebrated the deal, although Macintosh held only 2% of the market. IBM was not badly hurt; it had long planned to concentrate on chips for computer games.       Steve Jobs is preparing to abandon Apple Computer's 14-year commitment to chips developed by IBM and Motorola in favor of Intel processors. Apple has been frustrated by IBMs failure to deliver a G5 chip that does not generate much heat. After weeks of rumors, Jobs announced that the switch would be made by 2007. Apple must now persuade software developers to make their programs run on Intel chips. Apple's operating system is viewed as more stable and secure than Windows. Intel's CEO said his company is thrilled to have the world's most innovative personal computer company as a customer.       Steve Jobs told software engineers at Apple's annual developer conference in San Francisco that Apple will discontinue using IBM and Motorola chips in favor of Intel microprocessors. Apple engineers have secretly worked on a transition for five years. Every edition of Macintosh OS X since then has been designed to run on both IBM and Intel chips. Apple is producing Developer Transition Kits that will allow software developers to prepare applications to run on both chips. Apple's lower-end computers, like the Mac Mini, will get Intel chips in June 2006. Apple's entire computer line will have them by December 2007.       On 6 June Apple Computer announced plans to abandon its 14-year ties with IBM and Motorola in favor of Intel processors. Apple had been frustrated by IBM's inability to develop a chip that could process large amounts of data without overheating. Apple programs will have to be rewritten to run on an Intel-powered Mac, although engineers have already developed codes to ease the transition. Apple could lose sales in the short term, as people wait for the switch. The first Intel-powered Macs are scheduled for June 2006; all Macs should be converted by the end of 2007.",

An Intel processor inside a Macintosh put a whole library of Windows-based games and software within the reach of Mac users. Though there were benefits, skeptics questioned Apple's move; in the past, major transactions have lost customers and software developers. Apple helped launch a consortium designed to create new standards to improve the flow of content between TVs, computers and other devices. Speculation is that Apple plans to introduce a Mac Mini computer home entertainment hub.       Steve Jobs admitted that Apple had been working on the move to Intel for at least five years, creating two versions of its Mac OS X one with the current chips and another by Intel. Jobs said that Macs would top 3 gigahertz speed by summer. The Apple faithful had been caught by surprise by the company's switch. The new Intel chips that Mac will use is called Core Duo that features two computing engines on a single piece of silicon. The new IMacs will be up to two times faster than the older ones using the G5 chip.       In looking for alternative chips, Jobs talked with Sony but was disappointed with the Cell's design. Adobe Systems and Microsoft vowed to support Macs running existing and new hardware. Apple and Intel helped launch a tech consortium to create new standards to improve content flow between devices. Six months ahead of schedule, Apple introduced the new iMac, twice as fast as before but the same price; and MacBook Pro, four times faster than PowerBook laptops. Both use Intel's Core Duo processor that speeds up simultaneous tasks. The entire line of Macs will shift to Intel by the end of 2006.       On 10 January, six months ahead of schedule, Apple introduced two new Intel-based computers, an iMac and a laptop called the MacBook Pro. The new iMac is two to three times faster than the old model, while the laptop is four to five times faster, although they cost the same as the old models.

He took off at 6:47 and was concerned for a brief moment when the plane seemed to lose altitude seconds after taking off. By 10 PM he approached Canadian airspace and soared toward the Atlantic Ocean. While flying across Canada Fossett's GPS malfunctioned. After a couple of hours the GSP corrected itself. Monitoring fuel usage was a critical challenge during the flight. Fossett flew over Africa and the Middle East on Tuesday.

Fossett's plane, the Global Flyer, was designed by Burt Rutan and the flight is funded by Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic Airways. Departure depends on favorable weather. His plane does not carry enough fuel for the trip without tail winds. The flight will begin and terminate at Salina, Kansas. Fossettt hopes to make the trip in under 80 hours.

On Wednesday, while flying over mainland China mission control officials reported his fuel was 450 gallons less than expected. Fossett decided to fly to Hawaii to re-evaluate the situation. There he decided to proceed. The jet stream and great tailwinds over the Pacific allowed him to make up time. Fossett made a perfect landing in Salina Kansas after a 67-hour flight.       Fossett reached the half-way point while flying over India and he also picked up a 100 MPH jet stream boost. While he was over China, mission control officials concluded that he had less fuel than they had counted on. Despite this, Fossett decided to press on to Hawaii. On the final legs of his flight, Fossett stayed awake by drinking a dozen chocolate protein milkshakes. Slightly over 67 hours after departure from Salina, Fossett landed the Global Flyer on the same airstrip from which he had departed. The plane had enough fuel remaining to fly another 10 hours.

Over China there was concern about the fuel supply, but he decided to continue to Hawaii and at 2000 was east of Japan. As he was north of Hawaii, he again decided to continue because the jet stream was so strong. By 0930 on Thursday, he was 1,151 miles southwest of California.

ABC News stated, &quot;Peter died with his family around him, without pain and in peace.&quot; A friend said Jennings had faced lung cancer &quot;with realism, courage, and a firm hope that he would be one of the fortunate ones.&quot; In the end, he was not. Jennings' death brought to an end a decades-long era in television news dominated by three figures, CBS's Dan Rather, NBC'S Tom Brokaw and ABC's Jennings.       Although Jennings indicated that he would return as anchor when able, he was never able. In a letter posted on April 29 he described how treatments had proven more debilitating than he had anticipated. About a month later he appeared at ABC News headquarters, his voice soft and his body as much as twenty pounds lighter than usual, and mentioned that he had started radiation treatment. Up until his final days, Jennings believed he could win his battle with lung cancer, but on Aug. 7, 2005 he died at his home in New York.       Jennings had hoped to return to the anchor desk as his health and strength permitted. But he never did. He wrote later that he once decided to go to the office &quot;I got as far as the door. Chemo strikes&quot;. He also received radiation. He never again appeared on air. Until his final days, he believed he could win his battle but he died on 7 August at his home in New York. He was 67. President Bush paid tribute. More than 25,000 viewers posted messages on the ABC News site. A two-hour memorial service was held at Carnegie Hall.       Peter Jennings died from his lung cancer on August 7. He never appeared on the news after the taped April announcement. His treatments, which included radiation beginning in May, were too debilitating. He had lost 20 pounds the first month. Only 42% of lung cancer victims survive for at least one year. His death drew appreciation from national leaders, colleagues, and viewers. Two thousand people attended his September memorial service.",

        "summary": "In January 2005, Dennis Koslowski and Mark Swartz, former top executives of Tyco International Ltd., went on trial in New York a second time for stealing $600 million from the company. The first trial ended in a hung jury. Prosecutors claim the two men illegally awarded themselves millions of dollars in bonuses and concealed them from the company's board and shareholders. A judge refused to combine a retrial of larceny charges against Kozlowski with charges he failed to pay sales taxes on $13 million worth of art. If convicted, Koslowski and Swartz each could face 25 years in prison.       The first grand larceny trial of former Tyco CEO Dennis Kozlowski and codefendant Mark Swartz ended in mistrial. Their retrial began January 18. They allegedly stole $600 million from the company in unauthorized compensation and the sale of inflated Tyco stock. Kozlowski could face 30 years in prison. Prosecutors are focusing less on Kozlowski's life of excess and more on how he allegedly looted the company. In opening arguments, the defense suggested the compensation was legitimate, and company directors might be practicing revisionist history. Kozlowski still faces separate tax, conspiracy, falsifying business records and evidence tampering charges.       Former Tyco executive Dennis Kozlowski has been charged in a tax case with conspiracy, falsifying business records and tampering with evidence. He is accused of scheming with dealers to avoid paying over $1M tax on $13M of artworks. He and another Tyco executive, Mark Swartz, are also accused in a larceny case of looting over $600M from the company by illegally awarding themselves bonuses and concealing them from shareholders. A trial of the two ended in a hung jury. They are to be retried in New York. The judge refused separate trials.       The first unfocused, lengthy trial of Tyco executives Kozlowski and Swartz for stealing $600 million from Tyco was aborted after juror intimidation. The judge ruled a claim on behalf of Tyco was barred under Bermuda law, but allowed a class action lawsuit by Tyco shareholders. He refused to separate the two men's cases or allegations of accounting fraud and looting. In the retrial, prosecutors are concentrating on accusations that the men hid unauthorized bonuses, secretly forgave loans to themselves, and lied about Tyco's finances to inflate stock before selling it. The defense is trying to discredit the board of directors.",

        "summary": "Prosecutors changed tactics in the retrial of Kozlowski and Swartz from accusations of lavish spending used in the first trial, to a focus on charges that Kozlowski and Swartz had awarded themselves millions of dollars and concealed it from the board of Tyco. A retired board chairman testified he was never told about millions in forgiven loans and bonuses for the two executives. Tyco's former head of finance testified he never saw that millions of dollars in special bonuses were approved by a compensation committee. The VP of finance also said he wasn't aware of any documents to that effect.       In the prosecution's case, former Tyco executives were questioned, sometimes for days, about their knowledge or lack thereof about loans forgiven and bonuses paid to Dennis Kozlowski. On April 27, he took the stand in his defense. He denied abusing company loans and bonuses, testifying that the compensation committee leader, who has since died, approved them. He did admit to forgetfully omitting $25 million bonus that did not appear on his 1999 tax return. Cross-examination, which began on April 28, turned decidedly contentious by the third day. Kozlowski maintained his innocence and defended his lavish spending throughout.       Prosecutors in the trial of Kozlowski and Swartz say the two stole $150M by improperly forgiving company loans to themselves, taking unauthorized bonuses and having Tyco pay personal expenses. In a surprise move, Kozlowski testified in his own defense. He portrayed himself as an earnest, often harried, executive who rose through the ranks and had the support of the company's board. He could not explain why a $25M bonus did not appear on his tax return. Kozlowski finished four days of testimony insisting that he left it to lawyers and accountants to decide what to tell shareholders about his compensation.       The retired Tyco board chairman said he was never told about millions in forgiven loans and bonuses for Kozlowski. The former finance VP said he was unaware of compensation committee approval for the bonuses. Kozlowski took the stand in his retrial. He said deceased compensation committee head Phillip Hampton had approved the bonuses. Kozlowski thought a $20 million fee he paid a board member for arranging an acquisition did not require board authorization. Not including forgiven debt on his tax form was an oversight. His assistant decided to use Tyco loan money for certain payments but Kozlowski conceded his responsibility.",

Rita was upgraded to an extremely dangerous category 4 hurricane as it bore down on Texas. In the Gulf of Mexico Rita gained strength to a category 5 hurricane. One million people evacuated the Gulf Coast. Cuba set up 600 shelters in Havana housing 230000 evacuees. Oil companies evacuated staff from the Gulf as hurricane Rita approached, shutting down over 70 percent of US oil production in the area.       Rita, expected to become a major storm, is tracking a path that could follow that of Katrina. By Wednesday, Rita was upgraded to category three. President Bush declared a state of emergency in Texas and Louisiana as those states were bracing for Rita. As many as one million people were ordered to evacuate along the Gulf Coast. Rita was expected to land somewhere along the Texas gulf coast between Galveston and Corpus Christi and Texas Governor Perry has urged residents to begin evacuating. It poses a risk to the entire Houston region and has been upgraded to category four.       On Wednesday, Rita was upgraded to a Cat3 and reached a Cat5 by the afternoon. Cuba had shelters for 230,000 evacuees. President Bush declared a state of emergency in Texas and Louisiana. More residents of the Gulf coast were ordered to evacuate. Rita is aimed at Houston, where residents of the 100-year flood plain, storm surge areas, and mobile homes were urged to leave. About 319,000 National Guard troops have been mobilized. More than 70% of US oil production in the Gulf stopped, as crude oil prices rose. The Texas governor speculated Rita could become a Cat4 before landfall.       On Wednesday, with winds of 115 mph, Rita was upgraded to a level three hurricane. Royal Dutch Shell and BP evacuated all non-essential personnel from off-shore facilities. Later that day the storm was upgraded to a category five with winds of 165 mph. A state of emergency was declared in Texas and Louisiana. Mandatory evacuations were ordered for New Orleans and Galveston; over one million people along the coast were asked to evacuate voluntarily. About 320,000 National Guard troops were mobilized. The path of the hurricane was still uncertain, but it was expected to hit Texas or Louisiana.",

        "summary": "One way to get rid of carbon dioxide from coal-burning power plants is to bury it. Carbon sequestration is not new; petroleum producers have pumped compressed CO2 into oil-bearing structures to force oil to the surface for years. Norway has buried 70 million tons below the North Sea. Carbon dioxide from a coalgas plant in Wyoming is pumped 185 miles to a working oilfield in Canada. In 2004 scientists planned to sequester carbon in deep sandstone deposits. Coal gasification is necessary for sequestration. Improving the two technologies was part of a $35 billion package the Senate considered in 2005.       Carbon sequestration has been tested in the United States, Canada and Britain using old or working oil or gas fields as storage areas. Since 1996 Norway has buried nearly 70 million tons of compressed carbon below the North Sea where it had extracted fuels. In each case the CO2, after being captured by solvents, would be pumped into geologic formations which were thought to be safe storage areas. As efficient technology to compress, transport and store the carbon is developed it could be provided to developing countries such as China and India offering help in the fight against global warming.       Carbon sequestration, the process of capturing carbon dioxide produced by burning fossil fuels and storing it under the ground or ocean floor, is not a new idea and is gaining support. In Texas, scientists are burying tons of compressed carbon dioxide beneath an old oil field. Norway has buried tons below North Sea oilfields. The energy industry now injects compressed CO2 into the ground to make it easier to get oil out of the ground. Environmentalists say the plan is worth pursuing if safe, reliable, and dependent on cost. The question arises if the process could cause an earthquake.       Norway has stored waste CO2 below a North Sea oilfield since 1996. Texas geologists are pumping compressed CO2 into a sandstone layer one mile beneath an old Louisiana-Texas oil field. CO2 from a coalgas plant in Wyoming is being pumped under a working Weyburn, Saskatchewan oilfield. Britain will pump CO2 from a Scottish power station to an old North Sea oil reservoir. The US backs carbon sequestration development and coal gasification technology that can sequester siphoned-off CO2, and plans to use carbon sequestration for mercury control. Arizona is investigating combining CO2 with plentiful minerals to form chemically stable substances.",

        "summary": "The U.S. Energy Department announced that an experimental carbon sequestration project had been successful. CO2 from a coal burning plant in North Dakota was pumped to an oilfield in Canada. The test removed five million tons of CO2. Subsidiaries of BP and Edison International planned to build a $1 billion power plant in California that would capture 90% of the carbon dioxide produced and pump it into an oilfield. Oil companies Statoil ASA and Royal Dutch Shell PLC announced plans for similar plants. A pilot energy plant in Denmark using similar technology was scheduled to start in March 2006.       In Sept. 2005 a United Nations report said that application of carbon sequestration to power plants would become economical and that 99 percent of the carbon would not leak during the next 1000 years. In November the U.S. Department of Energy revealed than an experimental project with sequestration in a live oil field brought more oil to the surface. In 2006 plans were announced for similar projects in Britain and Norway with a Norwegian expert saying their project could increase oil recovery by at least 155 million barrels in its lifetime.       A UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change suggests carbon dioxide emissions should be captured from generating plants and refineries then compressed and stored in geological formations, oceans or in minerals. Underground storage could use technology already developed by the oil and gas industry. The US Department of Energy estimates that one-third to one-half of the emissions released into the atmosphere could be eliminated by this methodology. BP and Edison International subsidiaries plan to build a plant in Carson, California, where 90% of the carbon dioxide would be captured and pumped into an oilfield. A similar Danish project is underway.       The UN and EU recommend carbon sequestration. The EU signed an agreement with China that encourages it. Carbon sequestration tests in Algeria were promising. A joint US-Canadian project injects CO2 from coal gasification in ND into the Weyburn oil field in Saskatchewan. BP plans a power plant in Scotland that will sequester CO2, and with Edison International, one adjacent to a BP refinery in Carson, CA. Statoil ASA and Royal Dutch Shell plan a power plant in Tjeldbergodden, Norway, that will provide CO2 to Draugen and Heidrun offshore oil and gas fields.

        "summary": "After being caught, A.Q. Khan, Pakistan's revered father of its nuclear deterrent, admitted in February to black market dealings in nuclear weapons technology to Iran, Libya and North Korea. He was pardoned, but remains under house arrest. Recent investigations found evidence that Khan delivered bomb blueprints and weapons-grade enriched uranium to Iran. He sold warhead blueprints to Libya and possibly to North Korea. Evidence surfaced of his vast global enterprise, his facilities in Dubai and South Africa, and international connections from Asia to Africa. Pakistan's government expressed skepticism over recent claims and refuses to allow foreign authorities question Khan.       Abdul Qadeer Khan was a nuclear scientist who oversaw the spread of nuclear weapons to US adversaries. Khan did more to undermine US causes than Bin Laden, having confessed to transferring nuclear weapons technology to Iran, Libya, and North Korea. In November 2004 US officials and the UN's IAEA were still searching for other countries with Khan's digitized blueprints for nuclear manufacturing equipment and uranium enrichment centrifuges user manuals. Khan's network spread across 30 countries. Khan lives under house arrest in Islamabad. He was granted full pardon and allowed to keep the money believed to be from illicit sales.       A.Q. Khan sold nuclear bomb technology and material to Iran, North Korea and Libya. Possible motives were profit, ego, and a guarantee of Muslim influence. He traded centrifuge technology to China for bomb design. Pakistan claims to cooperate with the international community and put Khan under house arrest but won't let him be questioned. President Musharraf pardoned Khan, let him keep his profits, and denied government involvement. The US, not wanting to alienate ally Pakistan, quarreled with the IAEA and is investigating separately. Khan chief lieutenant Tahir is in jail. Khan's network operated in over 30 countries, including South Africa.       A.Q. Khan headed an illicit, global, network, providing nuclear information and material to at least Libya, Iran, and North Korea. He visited other potential customers and uranium suppliers. He appears motivated by hatred of India, monetary gain, egotism, and pan-Muslim and anti-Western goals. The US had tracked him for years and pressured his confession to nuclear proliferation in 2004, but could not be too forceful because of Pakistani cooperation in the war on terror. The Pakistani government placed Khan under house arrest, but pardoned him because he is a national hero. It denied any official knowledge of his activities.",

Ireland, Germany, Switzerland, Norway, South Africa, Bangladesh, Australia, Shanghai, Taiwan, and Eritrea ban plastic bags or charge a fee or fine for their use. In Ireland plastic bag use dropped 90 percent. Uganda, Kenya, and Rwanda are planning or considering banning or taxing plastic bags. Rwanda urges traditional basket use. Shop owners object. Tanzania is establishing a recycling plant.       Governments around the world are taking steps to control the blight of plastic bags. Basic steps are collecting and recycling, education programs, clean-ups, and building recycling plants. Other nations are placing taxes or fees on the use of these bags. The &quot;plastax&quot; is common in Europe and decreased the use of plastic bags in Ireland by 90% in one year. California cities are investigating this tax. The strongest step is banning the importation, production, and distribution of these bags including enforcement and high fines. Producers and merchants are opposed to taxes and bans. The general population's reactions are mixed.       Many countries including Ireland, South Africa, Bangladesh, Australia, Shanghai, Taiwan, Rwanda and Eritrea, have either banned plastic bags or charged a fee for their use. After Ireland imposed a fee of 15 cents a bag, their usage dropped by 90%. Some Rwandan shop owners have resorted to making bags out of newspapers. The U.S. has been slow to do anything. San Francisco was considering charging 17 cents a bag - a move opposed by grocers and the plastic industry. Los Angeles is considering a task force to consider ways to collect and recycle bags and to implement public education campaigns.",

Unfortunately, trends in developed countries are toward delaying parenthood. Several studies have found that, at least in teenagers, heavy cannabis use can be a contributory cause in triggering schizophrenia. Australian researchers have found a link between the impaired thought processes in schizophrenia and thinning grey matter in the brain. Schizophrenia evidently has a genetic component, but changes in the epigenome, natural chemical modifications of genes, after birth, may hold a clue to its non-genetic aspects.       There are statistical studies and partial explanations of the cause of schizophrenia, but no complete theory. Children born of older fathers are at higher risk. No schizophrenia-causing gene has been identified, but a few victims display a gene-mutation associated with Rett syndrome. Heavy daily use of marijuana starting before age 15 causes increased risk, but the risk decreases with age. Australian researchers found thinning of the outer layer of grey matter in the brain of victims. Other studies suggest environmental and social factors or natural chemical changes in a person's genome.       Research shows a strong link between schizophrenics and their fathers' age, demonstrating a hereditary factor exacerbated by sperm mutations that accumulate with age. Australian researchers linked the impaired thought process involved with schizophrenia to the thinning of grey matter in the brain. A growing body of research indicates that years of heavy marijuana (also known as cannabis) use significantly increases the risk of developing schizophrenia. The malfunction of certain microcircuits in the brain may cause schizophrenia. A study suggests that the epignome may hold a clue to schizophrenia's nongenetic aspects.

Scientists knew that vitamin A plays an important role in schizophrenia, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's; now they've discovered it acts upon a gene that influences neuron activity. Damage to the enzyme PDE4B increases the risk of developing mental illness, and researchers have discovered that the gene DISC1 acts as a regulator for PDE4B. Some scientists believe that lack of insulin in the brain may cause schizophrenia, but they reject &quot;insulin shock therapy,&quot; popular mid-20th century.       Recent studies demonstrate that schizophrenia has a genetic basis and results from chemical abnormalities in the brain. The long-standing belief in problems of childhood as a cause has been largely discarded, but environmental factors are still seen as playing a role. Famine, malnutrition, or infection of a pregnant woman may cause changes in a developing fetal brain and heavy smoking of marijuana by teenagers may trigger a genetic predisposition. One study identifies insulin as a factor. The same 14 genes found missing in the brains of schizophrenics were missing in the muscles of diabetics.       A renowned psychiatrist believed that schizophrenia was related to neurological impairments rather than childhood problems. Recent studies have demonstrated that disorders like schizophrenia have a genetic basis. Evidence that children from malnourished women are more likely to develop schizophrenia supports the theory that schizophrenia is caused by a genetic predisposition influenced by environmental triggers. Researchers found that levels of a chemical messenger in the brain called GABA were abnormal in schizophrenics and linked to a miswired network. For decades scientists linked schizophrenic symptoms to abnormalities in the brain chemical dopamine. Studies later identified genes that make people susceptible to schizophrenia.       Research shows that schizophrenia is caused by a genetic predisposition influenced by environmental triggers, including infection and severe maternal malnutrition, that disturb the developing fetal brain. Vitamin A, possibly proteins PDE4B and DISC1, and reduced GABA and insulin levels play roles in schizophrenia. Dopamine is linked to schizophrenic delusions and hallucinations. Other brain chemicals contribute to confusion and emotional unresponsiveness. Smoking pot in adolescence increases schizophrenic risk. Fourteen genes are missing in schizophrenics' brains. Drugs have been used to mimic schizophrenic changes in rats, possibly providing a first animal test subject. Schizophrenia is unrelated to childhood problems and fears.",

Nearly daily conflicting reports of his condition followed. Possible ailments included the flu, a blood disease and cancer. On October 29, Arafat was flown to a military hospital near Paris. He was transferred to the intensive care unit on November 3. By November 9, a flurry of conflicting reports of his death, or near-death condition circulated. Palestinian factions met to discuss arrangements following his death. Israeli and Palestinian officials came to an agreement about his funeral arrangements.       Yasser Arafat's wife controlled dissemination of information about his health. Reports differed on the severity of his illness and whether he was alive. He was transferred to a French military hospital near Paris. His condition later deteriorated. He suddenly went into a deep coma and death seemed imminent. Palestinian sources said he would be buried in the West Bank. Ariel Sharon said he could be buried in Gaza. Egypt might host the funeral services. Israeli and Palestinian officials met to discuss funeral arrangements but would not reveal them.       On October 23, Tunisian doctors were allowed to see Yasser Arafat, who was hospitalized two days later. Rumors on his ailment and condition began spreading. On October 28, his move to a Paris hospital was approved. He entered the intensive care unit on November 3. As contradicting reports of his condition continued, rumors on his funeral and burial began to surface. Arafat supposedly wanted a Jerusalem grave. This is opposed by Israel, which wants burial in the Gaza Strip. Palestinian sources mentioned Ramallah. Egypt offered to host the funeral. Agreement among Palestinian and Israeli officials was reached on November 9.       Yasser Arafat's health declined in late October and he was flown to a military hospital outside Paris on Friday 29 October. On Wednesday 3 November he was transferred to the intensive care unit. Since then there have been conflicting reports about whether or not he has died. Funeral plans were under discussion and the 13 main Palestinian factions met on Tuesday to discuss arrangements. Egypt might host funeral services. France reached an agreement with Israel for Arafat to be buried at his headquarters in Ramallah. Israel refused to allow him to be buried in Jerusalem.",

        "summary": "The Washington Nationals expect 45,000 for their home opener with President Bush throwing the first ceremonial pitch. More than 22,000 season tickets have been sold. Manager Frank Robinson saw the team win its opening home stand tied for first place. The team expects a pre-tax profit of $20M. Eight groups interested in ownership could bid up to $400M. Republicans oppose allowing a group that includes billionaire liberal George Soros to become owners of the Nationals. National's games have limited TV exposure due to legal battles resulting, in part, from the Orioles opposition to the move of the Expos to Washington.       The Nationals home opener was sold out. Fans were excited to have baseball in Washington again. For subsequent games, although the Nationals were in first place and playing well, they played to two-thirds capacity, with little season-ticket base. Bidders for ownership include George Soros, Colin Powell, and other political figures. Nationals have one of the lowest player payrolls in baseball. RFK Stadium is old and must be shared with soccer team DC United. The pitchers mound is lowered for soccer games and built up again but gives pitchers problems. Legal problems between Comcast and Peter Angelos limit Nationals TV exposure.       The Washington Nationals enjoyed a very successful beginning to the baseball season. By June, the team was on pace to earn a $22 million profit. The residents were excited, merchandise sales were in the top five, the Nationals outdrew the Orioles, and attendance was the ninth highest. The wily manager and his no-name players led the National League on June 26, despite the low payroll and nonexistent farm system. Significant issues, however, remain; the team has still not been sold, games are not on local cable, and sharing the dated stadium with a major league soccer team creates problems.       As of 13 April, the Nationals were tied for first in their division. They won their opening home game 5-3 over Arizona before a sold-out stadium and by 11 June had won 10 of 11 games. More than 22,000 season tickets have been sold and the team may make a pre-tax profit of $20 million in its first season. Attendance has been strong. Legal problems have limited their television exposure. Some Washingtonians have protested that money should be spent on new schools, not a stadium.",

Minutes after the announcement political leaders and lobby groups prepared for the ensuing battle. Liberals did not want an &quot;extremist&quot; and Republicans wanted a judge who would apply rather than interpret the Constitution. President Bush's choice of a judge was important because of key cases in abortion, assisted suicide and gay rights. One of the difficulties in nominating a judge is that they do not always vote the way one would assume, given their political affiliation or ideology.       Sandra Day O'Connor, the first woman to serve on the US Supreme Court, is retiring. She gave no reason but a Court spokesman indicated her need to spend more time with her husband who has Alzheimer's. O'Connor, the first woman to serve on the Court was considered a conservative when seated but became more moderate over the years. President Reagan appointed her in 1981. President Bush now has his first opportunity to nominate someone to the high court and promises to do so in a timely manner. Liberals warned against picking an &quot;extremist&quot; while Republicans argued for a strict conservative.       Sandra O'Connor, 75, appointed to the Supreme Court by Reagan in 1981 and first woman on the court, announced her retirement, effective on confirmation of her successor. She will spend time with her Alzheimer's-patient husband. Bush promised to be deliberate, thorough, and timely in choosing a successor; to have no litmus test on abortion or gay marriage; and to pick a strict constitutionist who will not legislate from the bench. This first vacancy in 11 years gives Bush the chance to shape court ideological balance. O'Connor was a frequent swing vote. Bush chastised critics of Alberto Gonzales as a candidate.       July 1, 2005 Supreme Court Justice O'Connor resigned, effective with the confirmation of her successor. One of only two female justices, she gave no reason. She is 75, has served 24 years, and her husband has Alzheimer's disease. President Bush began a &quot;deliberate and thorough&quot; hunt for a replacement. Liberals warned him to avoid an extremist, while conservatives urged him to pick a strict constructionist. Four male federal judges and the Attorney General were mentioned. Abortion is a key question. Many discussed past appointments where a justice surprised the president by making a shift - to the right or left.",

Roberts for a seat on the Supreme Court Abortions Rights Groups directed their members to call their senators to express opposition. Conservative activist groups voiced strong support for Roberts. There were early hints that Roberts would likely be confirmed. For one, Bush had passed over candidates who would have made conservative groups happier. Bushed urged the divided US Senate to confirm Roberts by early October. Republican reaction to the nominee was overwhelmingly supportive, but Democrats reacted more cautiously and with reservations, admitting that Roberts had suitable legal credentials.       President Bush nominated a conservative favorite, appellate court judge John Roberts, to the US Supreme Court to replace O'Connor. In doing so he resisted pressure to name a woman or Hispanic. O'Connor was a crucial swing vote on the court. Liberals fear and conservatives hope that Roberts' s confirmation will move the court decidedly to the right O'Connor said of Roberts: &quot;He's good in every way, except he's not a woman&quot;. Pro-choice activists indicated opposition to Roberts who, as a lawyer in the first Bush Administration, helped write a brief that argued Roe v. Wade should be overturned.       Bush nominated conservative federal appeals court Judge John G. Roberts, 50, to replace Sandra O'Connor. Liberals and abortion rights supporters immediately mobilized their opposition. Conservatives began their campaign to support Roberts before he was announced. Both sides have spent years preparing for this, poring over records of potential nominees and amassing war chests. Roberts has been a judge for only two years but was considered fair. Roberts has argued that Roe vs. Wade was wrongly decided and ruled that special military tribunals at Guantanamo Bay could proceed. Roberts was expected to be confirmed. Bush passed over even more conservative candidates.       On July 19, Bush named John G. Roberts, Jr. to replace Justice O'Connor. Roberts graduated from Harvard Law School, clerked for Chief Justice Rehnquist, and worked in two Republican administrations. He has been a judge on the federal appeals court for one year, creating no record on controversial subjects such as abortion and federalism. The release of some documents from his White House service is expected. Many regret that he is a white male, as were all but four of past nominees. Although liberals and conservatives are ready for a fight in the Senate, intense acrimony is not expected.",

This added to the uproar caused by the shooting and by Cheney's staff delaying a report of the incident for 20 hours. Cheney accidentally sprayed Whittington with bird shot in the face, neck and chest while they hunted on a ranch in south Texas. Whittington, 78, a prominent lawyer, was treated on the scene by Cheney's medical detail before being taken by helicopter to a Corpus Christi hospital. He was in stable condition the next day. Cheney was apologetic.       On Feb. 11, 2006 Vice President Cheney shot a hunting companion in Texas. Cheney turned and fired at a covey of birds, not realizing that his friend, Whittington, was in the line of fire. Whittington was immediately treated and hospitalized. The accident was reported by a local newspaper the following day and only then did Cheney's office confirm the event, 20 hours after it happened. Controversy surrounds the event. Who was at fault? Why didn't the White House announce the accident sooner? Cheney handled the matter of an illegal hunting license by mailing a $7 check to Texas.       Vice President Dick Cheney accidentally shot a hunting partner on February 11 during a weekend quail hunting trip in Texas. Cheney's friend, attorney Harry Whittington from Austin, was sprayed in the face, neck, and chest with birdshot. Whittington was reported to be in stable condition in a Corpus Christi hospital. The incident was first reported by the Corpus Christi Caller-Times. Cheney's office disclosed the accident 20 hours after it occurred. White House staff was criticized for the delay. The incident provided a wealth of material for Democrats, gun control activists and late night comedians.       On a Texas ranch on February 11, 2006, Vice President Cheney accidentally shot a hunting companion, Harry Whittington, 78. Whittington, peppered on the right side, received emergency care and then was flown to a Corpus Christi hospital. He was moved from the intensive care unit on February 13. Eyewitnesses said the shooting was Whittington's fault. Although the White House was notified within hours, the news was not made public until nearly 20 hours, when, with Cheney's permission, the ranch hostess alerted the local press. The timing and manner of notification drew sharp criticism from observers and the White House.",

        "summary": "Harry Whittington, the Texas lawyer shot by Vice President Cheney, suffered a heart attack as a result of birdshot in his heart. One of the 100 shotgun pellets that wounded him moved into his heart and caused the attack. Doctors decided not to remove the pellet, saying they would treat his condition medically. The White House Press Secretary learned about the heart attack just before a press conference, but he did not mention it. The accident and heart attach caused a media frenzy. Some Cheney friends blamed Whittington, but five days later, Cheney spoke to the media, accepting full responsibility.       On Feb. 14 Whittington suffered a setback when a shotgun pellet penetrated his heart. His worsened condition focused attention on the unanswered questions: Whose fault and why the delay in reporting? In Texas a sheriff's office cleared Cheney of any wrongdoing. On the question of delay, Bush's staff deferred to Cheney's and Cheney's to their Texas hosts. On Feb. 15 Cheney broke his silence in a Fox News interview, accepting full-blame for the shooting, but defending his decision to leave the reporting of the incident to the owner of the ranch where it occurred.       An Austin Lawyer accidentally shot by Vice President Cheney suffered a minor heart attack February 14 as a result of birdshot in his heart. He is in stable condition and is still expected to fully recover. Doctors are optimistic the pellet won't cause future problems. Democrats accused Cheney of a pattern of secrecy for his delay in reporting the incident. He spoke about the incident in an interview on February 15, calling the day one of the worst of his life and accepting full blame for the accident. A Texas sheriff's office cleared Cheney of any wrongdoing in the incident.       A buckshot pellet caused Whittington to suffer atrial fibrillation and a &quot;silent&quot; heart attack by the morning of February 14. He was returned to intensive care. Between 5 and 200 pellets are lodged in his body. He's expected to remain hospitalized for a week. Cheney's office released its first statement that afternoon, as conflicting stories began to surface. The handling of the incident highlighted the administration's penchant for secrecy and tensions between Bush's and Cheney's staffs. On the afternoon of the 15th during a FOX News interview, Cheney accepted blame for the shooting, but defended the information handling.",

They were to be directors of the foundation that would construct, own, operate and maintain the memorial. Architect Michael Arad's design was chosen from 5,201 entries in an international competition. It featured two reflecting pools surrounded by gardens. Part of the $500 million in financing will come from New York's $816 million in federal grants.       The World Trade Center Foundation held its first meeting on January 6. Its priority is raising $500 million to build a memorial and two cultural buildings. The four living former US presidents are honorary directors. Prominent foundation members include Robert De Niro, Barbara Walters, David Rockefeller, and former Canadian prime minister Brian Mulroney. Michael Arad's design, Reflecting Absence, was chosen for the memorial. It is planned to include a forest of oak trees and a Memorial Hall. An underground interpretive center will house artifacts from the 1993 and 2001 attacks. The memorial is scheduled to open in 2009.       The task of raising $500M for the World Trade Center memorial will fall to foundation made up of leaders from finance and real estate, cultural leaders, media celebrities and relatives of 9/11 victims. All four living ex-presidents of the US have agreed to become honorary directors of the project. The foundation is accepting all levels of gifts. Governor Pataki said financing of the memorial should be the top priority for allocating money from the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation's $816M grant. The WTC memorial named &quot;Reflecting Absence&quot; features two reflecting pools surround by gardens. It was chosen from 5201 entries.       In December 2004, 31 people were named to the board of directors of the World Trade Center (WTC) Memorial Foundation. This is a non-profit corporation to oversee fundraising and construction, then own and operate the memorial on the WTC site. The memorial will have a plaza, fountains, ramps, building and human remains, names of victims, and fragments of the 1993 memorial. There also will be an interpretation center, museum and arts center. Its completion is scheduled for 2009. The foundation is faced with raising almost 1/2 billion dollars and overseeing the reconciliation of the architectural vision with the physical realities.",

He also planned to push ahead the timetable for redesign of the Freedom Tower office building. By doing so Pataki admitted the effort to build the memorial had suffered serious setbacks. Families of the victims criticized the design, including the cultural building: Too large; the streetwalls; too high. They objected to changes: Two pedestrian ramps instead of four. The original design was being whittled away. Goldman Sachs suspended plans to build a $2 billion 40-story headquarters at the site.       The World Trade Center memorial project has bogged down while negotiations over issues of condemnation and imminent domain are hashed out. Design revisions have further complicated the project. Family members of 9/11 victims expressed displeasure with many of the proposed amendments to Arad's design. They believe the memorial has taken a backseat to commercial interests and have called for a fundraising boycott. New York's governor announced he will appoint his chief of staff to take control of the rebuilding effort. He will also use public funds to jumpstart the fundraising effort. A temporary memorial will open on July 11.       Elements of the original design for the WTC memorial have been whittled away by logistical realities, client demands and concerns expressed by family members of the 2,749 WTC victims. The Freedom Tower meant to rise from the ashes will be redesigned because of security concerns. The proposed reduction of four pedestrian ramps to two raised safety concerns. The memorial itself is expected to cost $350M including the Memorial Center - a separate design. Governor Pataki assigned his chief of staff to coordinate the work of each agency and institution involved in the redevelopment of and around the memorial.       Spring and early summer brought more controversies to the WCT Memorial. A new Foundation CEO was named. One last parcel of land still was needed. Various interest groups were battling over aspects of the ground zero area including the International Freedom Center, the Drawing Center, the Performing arts center, and the Freedom Tower office building. The families of victims were fighting commercial interests. The Foundation's money drive is falling short, but the governor has promised some public funds. Elements of the original design are continually being altered. Two spot-gap memorial projects were begun in June and July.",

        "summary": "Juan Alvarez left his car on a railroad track in Glendale CA. It set off a collision that derailed two trains, killed at least 10 people and injured nearly 200. Witnesses identified Alvarez and he was detained. He was distraught and put on suicide watch. Glendale police believed he intended to commit suicide but changed his mind. He was taken into custody and charged with at least 10 counts of homicide. Investigators felt Alvarez wanted to kill himself because his estranged wife denied him visits with his children. He was held on suspicion of murder in Los Angeles without bail.       A man intent on suicide left his car on a railroad track in Glendale, California, where it set off a collision that derailed two commuter trains and killed ten people (later raised to eleven) and injured nearly 200. Police held Juan Manuel Alvarez on ten counts of murder and indicated that he had intended suicide but changed his mind and fled his vehicle before the train struck. Alvarez, who had self-inflicted superficial wounds, remained at the scene and was cooperating with police. He has a criminal record involving drugs and his wife obtained a restraining order against him.       Juan Manuel Alvarez drove his SUV onto Glendale train tracks in a suicide attempt. When his SUV got stuck between the tracks he got out and left. A southbound Metrolink commuter train crashed into the immovable SUV and climbed over it. The front cab car rammed into an adjacent stationary Union Pacific work train and toppled it. The remaining cars jackknifed and derailed a northbound Metrolink commuter train. The accident and subsequent fire killed 11 and injured 200. Alvarez watched the crash then attempted suicide again by slashing his wrists and stabbing himself. He was arrested and charged with homicide.       A train crash in Glendale, California, on 26 January killed 11 people and injured close to 200, many critically. A southbound commuter train, pushed from behind by a locomotive, hit an SUV lodged on the tracks, then hit a freight train and a northbound commuter train. Police arrested Juan Manuel Alvarez, the driver of the SUV, who had jumped from the car just before the impact. At first, self-inflicted wounds on his wrists and chest led investigators to think that it was an attempted suicide. It was determined later that he got the wounds after he fled the scene.",

The LA County DA expressed serious doubts about law enforcers' comments that Alvarez was deranged or insane and suggested he may have been trying to send a message to his estranged wife when he left his SUV on the tracks. Alvarez remained heavily sedated and under suicide watch. Prosecutors said he caused the crash to get his wife's attention and sympathy. Alvarez pled not guilty to murder and arson charges and prosecutors sought the death penalty against him.       Prosecutors added arson to the 11 counts of murder with special circumstances against Alvarez after it was determined that he had poured gasoline on his vehicle. The district attorney has contradicted the police and has suggested that his act was calculated and not a suicidal or insane act. A Glendale policeman said that Alvarez planned to create a &quot;spectacular&quot; scene to gain his wife's sympathy. Alvarez has pleaded not guilty to all counts and is being held without bail. His lawyer maintains he was despondent over his marriage break-up and planned to kill himself but not others.

Train 100's lead car pushed the SUV down the track, derailed, turned on its side and slid into a freight car, toppling it. As Train 901 passed, the jackknifed Train 100 cars derailed 901's rear two cars. Alvarez was trying to create a spectacle to win back his estranged wife, not commit suicide. He slashed his arms and chest superficially with scissors. Alvarez pleaded not guilty to 11 counts of murder and arson with special circumstances (train wrecking). Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty.       It appeared that Alvarez had not slashed his wrists and that his other wounds were not life-threatening. He was charged with murder. Arson was added to the murder charges because forensic tests had revealed the presence of gasoline in and on the SUV and witnesses said that they had seen him douse the car before abandoning it. Alvarez might have intended to create a spectacular scene to get his wife's sympathy. In May he pleaded not guilty to murder and arson charges. Prosecutors will seek the death penalty.",

The park employed 5000 people and was predicted to draw 5.6 million people the first year. Two weeks after opening Disneyland activists were concerned about the harsh working conditions. Disney officials discouraged unionizing. The HKSAR government defended the park against the labor conditions, saying Disney needed time to learn the local culture. Two months after the park opened, Disneyland lowered the ticket price, denying it was related to low attendance, and refused to discuss attendance. The HKSAR government argued they should reveal attendance numbers to them because they were the largest Disneyland investor.       HK and Disney agreed to build the park in 1999, with HK majority owner. Construction began in 2003. On opening day, Sept. 12, 2005, 16,000 people attended and demonstrators protested labor abuses at Chinese factories making Disney products. Park workers describe long hours, long travel times, harsh turnarounds and lack of breaks. Activists want HK Disneyland workers to unionize but Disney resists, despite unions at US and French Disneylands. Disney denies low attendance and is criticized for lack of transparency. Disney offered local residents discounted tickets. Mainland China, expected to be the major source of visitors, provided only 25 percent.       Hong Kong Disneyland opened as scheduled on 12 September. Over 80% of the visitors in the first month rated their experience as very good or excellent. The park drew fewer visitors than expected in its first two months, despite offering a discount for HK residents. Disneyland steadfastly refused to disclose attendance figures - a move that angered lawmakers since the government owns a 57% stake the park. In late November Disney said that there had been &quot;well over&quot; one million guests. Workers complained about long hours, short turnarounds, and lack of breaks.",

Huygens would spend three weeks descending toward Titan, shooting pictures for 2-1/2 hours before hitting the surface. Titan is the only moon in the Solar System that has an atmosphere. During the seven years mothership Cassini took to reach the ringed planet, the attached Huygens probe was powered through an umbilical cable and awakened from sleep mode every six months for tests.       After a seven-year journey, the Huygens space probe successfully separated from the Cassini spacecraft orbiting Saturn at about 10:24 p.m. EST December 24, beginning its three-week, 2 million-mile free fall toward Saturn's moon Titan. It will remain dormant until January 14, when it will float to the moon's surface on parachutes, shooting pictures and sending back data for about 2.5 hours before hitting the surface. Scientists hope Huygens will confirm the assumption that Titan's atmosphere is similar to that of early Earth. The mission is a joint project of NASA, the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency.         Huygens is a 9-foot landing probe, built by the European Space Agency. It is riding on the Cassini spacecraft, launched from Cape Canaveral on October 15, 1997. Cassini flew twice past Venus, once past Earth, and once past Jupiter - 2.2 billion miles - before its first orbit around Saturn began on July 1, 2004. It continued these orbits until December 24. On that date, Huygens separated from the mother ship and began a forecasted 20-day, 2.5 million mile ballistic path to Titan, the most intriguing moon of Saturn. Huygens is designed to study Titan's atmosphere and take photographs.       The Huygens space probe, built and managed by the European Space Agency, was carried by NASA's Cassini spacecraft on a 7-year journey to Saturn. It separated successfully from Cassini on Christmas Eve and began a 2.5-million-mile 20-day descent to Saturn's largest moon Titan, the only moon in the solar system that has atmosphere. During its descent it will sample Titan's atmosphere. Everything must work perfectly because there is no way to adjust Huygens' course. Progress was being carefully followed by NASA and the 16 European nations involved in the project.",

        "summary": "In early 2005, a Taiwanese official said Beijing's plan to pass an anti-secession law was aimed at legalizing a mainland invasion of his country. It would undermine stabililty across the Taiwan Strait, according to Taiwan's President Chen. Taiwan sent six delegations to the U.S., Japan and EU countries the year before to brief officials on the adverse impact on cross-strait relations the law would have. Beijing said in March, that &quot;one country, two systems&quot; was its basic approach to Taiwan, outlining, for the first time, its anti-secession law that was being considered by the National People's Congress.       Planned consideration of an Anti-secession Law (ASL) by China's National People's Congress (NPC) stirred strong reactions in Taiwan. Taiwanese see the bill as establishing a legal justification for a military invasion of Taiwan. Furthermore, the ASC would diminish cross-Taiwan strait travel and restrict free expression of ideas, hindering cross-strait rapprochement. Taiwan claimed the support of the United States and European Union in opposing the measure. On March 8, 2005 as the NPC began deliberations on the bill, spokesmen defended the ASL as a means of promoting China's peaceful reunification on the basis of &quot;one country, two systems.&quot;       The PRC claims the anti-secession law to be deliberated by its legislative body in March is aimed at promoting a peaceful reunification with Taiwan. It denies that it would be used to justify military action. The PRC maintains that the one country, two systems approach is best for Taiwan. Taiwan fears the anti-secession law is designed to legalize a Beijing military invasion. It says it is a provocation that would undermine stability across the Taiwan Strait. Its ruling and opposition parties agreed to adopt a resolution against the Beijing law. The US and EU support Taiwan's position.       Taiwan considers the PRC's plan to enact an anti-secession law a provocative move to change the status quo in the Taiwan Strait. Emphasizing that Taiwan is not a part of the PRC as Beijing claims, Taiwan believes the legislation is aimed at establishing a legal justification for Beijing's invasion of the island. The U.S. and E.U.consider the legislation counterproductive to peace. The PRC claims that the law is designed to check the secessionist activities of &quot;Taiwan independence&quot; forces and promote China's reunification. The PRC legislature is scheduled to take up the anti-secession law in March.",

        "summary": "Two men accused of bombing an Air India jet, killing 329 people in 1985, were tried in Vancouver nearly 20 years later. Prosecutors charged that a millionaire named Malik and a millworker named Bagri were Sikhs taking revenge against the Indian government, which owned Air India planes, for attacking a Sikh temple in 1984. The prosecution's case rested upon their providing financial assistance to a man convicted in the case, attempting to interfere with investigations, and admissions to people they trusted. Defense lawyers attacked the credibility of witnesses. There were years of bungled police work and unexplained killings of witnesses.       Two Sikhs, Ripudaman Malik and Ajaib Bagri, were charged with the 1985 bombing of an Air India jet that killed 329 passengers and with killing two baggage handlers at Narita Airport. Final arguments in their murder trial concluded in December 2004. Prosecutors believe the Sikhs' motive was to avenge India's 1984 attack on the Golden Temple in Amritsar. The trial was not settled due to years of bungled police work, unexpected killings of witnesses and a suspect, and vague and contradictory testimonies. Justice Ian Josephson, who heard the case without a jury, will deliver his decision in March 2005.       Ripudaman Malik and Ajaib Bagri have been in custody over four years accused of bombing an Air India jumbo jet in June 1985 killing 329 people. Prosecutors believe the two British Columbia-based Sikh extremists acted in revenge against the Indian government for attacking a Sikh temple in 1984. The trial is being held in a bomb-proof court built especially for this trial, the largest and most complex in Canadian history. More than 100 witnesses have testified. Some key witnesses have offered vague and contradictory recollections. Two potential witnesses were assassinated and others received threats. Key evidence is circumstantial.       Final arguments were presented in the British Columbian trial of two Indian Sikh immigrants accused of involvement in two bombings: an Air India jet which exploded off the Irish coast in 1985, killing all 329 aboard; and a bomb that killed two baggage handlers in Tokyo. The prosecution held that the men wanted revenge against the Indian government for attacking Sikhdom's most holy temple in 1984. The defense argued against the credibility of three key witnesses. There is no physical evidence or first-hand testimony linking the suspects to the bombings. The judge will deliver a decision on 16 March.",

        "summary": "A judge acquitted two Indian-Born Canadian Sikhs charged with bombing an Air India jumbo jet, killing 329 people. The unexpected end, after 19 months of a trial that cost $80 million dollars, left the worst case of mass murder in Canadian history an unsettled mystery. The judge, who had presided without a jury, said he did not believe the testimony of witnesses who linked the men to the bombing. The evidence had fallen &quot;markedly short&quot; of the standard required to convict the men. Families of passengers who perished proclaimed a &quot;mockery of justice&quot; and demanded a government investigation.       In March 2005 Judge Josephson acquitted Ripudaman Malik and Ajaib Bagir on eight counts of murder and conspiracy because the government had failed to make a conclusive case. Plane crash victims' families were devastated and demanded a public inquiry. The Canadian Deputy Prime Minister could see no benefit to calling a public inquiry. The Canadian Police were disappointed at the call. Prosecutors sought grounds to appeal Josephson's ruling. Canada's newspapers were shocked at the acquittals of the two Sikhs and the Toronto-based Globe and Mail devoted its front page to the headline &quot;innocent&quot; and the names of the 329 victims.       British Columbia Supreme Court Justice Ian Josephson has acquitted the two Canadian Sikhs ending the four-year trial that was conducted without a jury. He said that despite the horrific nature of the alleged crimes, there could be no lowering the standard of proof and that the assortment of prosecution witnesses lacked credibility. The decision devastated family members of the victims. Shocked prosecutors must ponder whether there is ground for appeal and defend their decision to bring the case to court. The feasibility of an appeal is in question because of strong wording of Josephson's verdict. The case remains open.       On 16 March, the judge acquitted the two Canadian Sikhs charged in the Air India bombings. Saying that the prosecution's major witnesses were not credible, the British Columbia Supreme Court Justice stated that the prosecution had failed to prove the men guilty beyond a reasonable doubt but added that he was certain both bombs had originated on flights out of Vancouver. He had heard the case without a jury at the defendants' request. The two Sikhs were released immediately. The verdict shocked everyone. Many people sharply criticized the police and secret services and demanded a government investigation.",

Justices Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer were expected to vote against the death penalty while Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices Scalia and Thomas would be for it. Justices Kennedy and O'Connor appeared to be &quot;swing votes.&quot; In the initial hearing Kennedy expressed concerns about exempting 16-17-year-olds but also noted that &quot;world opinion is against us&quot; in executing juveniles. O'Connor noted that several states had already raised the minimum age for execution to 18.       On October 13, 2004, the Supreme Court struggled over the legality of the death penalty for criminals under age 18 in Roper v. Simmons. Simmons' attorney argued that a national consensus has emerged that the death penalty for juveniles is cruel and unusual punishment. He compared this case to the 2002 case in which the court abolished the death penalty for mentally retarded offenders. The Missouri Attorney General argued that the court should uphold the execution of minors because some crimes are so heinous as to warrant it. Justices Kennedy's and Day O'Connor's votes are likely to be pivotal.       The Supreme Court heard arguments on Roper v Simmons on October 13, 2004. Its decision will determine whether the death penalty can be given for crimes committed by 16 and 17 year olds. The court ended the death penalty for those 15 and younger in 1988 and mentally retarded in 2002. The outcome appears dependent on the votes of Justices O'Connor and Kennedy. Key issues are has the nation's consensus changed, should world consensus influence US law, and the brain development of these youngsters. Since 1976, 22 have been executed. Now 73 people are on death row in 12 states.       In Roper v. Simmons the Supreme Court heard arguments challenging the constitutionality of the death penalty for criminals under 18. The defense argued that minors were not fully developed intellectually or morally and that therefore such executions violate the constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment. It asserted that a national consensus had emerged on that subject and pointed out that the U.S. is the only country in the world that allows the execution of juveniles. Prosecutors contended that Simmons was old enough to know right from wrong and challenged the notion that a national consensus had emerged.",

On March 1, 2005, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the death penalty for murderers who were under age 18 at the time of their crime is unconstitutional.

He noted that the US was the last remaining nation to abolish the death penalty for minors. His comment reignited debate over the court's consideration of foreign laws and opinions when interpreting the Constitution.       On March 1, 2005, the US Supreme Court declared that the death sentence for crimes committed by 16 and 17 year olds was cruel and unusual punishment, thus violating the 8th Amendment. Justice Kennedy wrote the majority opinion citing the emotional immaturity of teenagers, the changing national consensus, and the weight of international opinion against executing minors. The dissenting opinions disputed these points. Justice O'Connor voted with the conservatives, Rehnquist, Thomas and Scalia.       In Roper v. Simmons the Supreme Court ruled 5-to-4 that executing 16- and 17-year-olds violated the Constitution's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. The decision noted that the brains of adolescents function differently from those of adults and observed that American society believes that adulthood begins at 18 in regard to voting, serving on a jury, or marrying without parental consent. It also stated that the &quot;national consensus&quot; on capital punishment had changed and that the U.S. was the only country that allowed the execution of minors, thus confirming the importance of international opinion.",
