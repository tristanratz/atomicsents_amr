    "summary": " Since they became separate nations in 1947, India and Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir, the Himalayan province which was split between them. Kashmir is India's only majority Islam province, and an Islam insurgency began on the Indian side in 1989. More than 45,000 people were killed. A bilateral cease fire was pronounced in 2003, and Prime Minister Singh of India reduced troop levels by 40,000 in a force of 500,000. Peace talks began in 2004 and in March 2005, bus service between the two countries began, the first tangible result of the peace talks. During November 2004, India's prime minister reduced troops on the Kashmir border as a goodwill gesture prior to his visit. While there, he met with Kashmiri separatist leaders. India rejected a Pakistani suggestion that some Kashmir areas be made independent, placed under joint control, or put under UN administration. The Indian and Pakistani prime ministers were to meet in New Delhi to further the peace process begun in January and facilitated by a year-long ceasefire. Consequently, on April 7, 2005, limited bi-weekly bus service between the Indian- and Pakistani-controlled sections of Kashmir resumed for the first time in 57 years. A border ceasefire begun November 25, 2003 has held. The US pressured Pakistan to control militant groups. India's early 2004 talks with Kashmiri separatists showed little progress. India and Pakistan were to start formal talks on Kashmir in December. Pakistani President Musharraf suggested making Kashmir autonomous or putting parts under joint India/Pakistan or UN control. Indian PM Singh committed to making peace with Pakistan but rejected redrawing the border. India withdrew some border troops. Singh visited Kashmir three times and announced a Kashmiri economic development plan. Bus service between the Indian and Pakistani zones started in April 2005. There appears to be progress in the Indian-Pakistani dispute over Kashmir. The bilateral ceasefire has held for a year. The Indian Prime Minister met with Kashmiri political leaders for the first time. India has reduced the number of border troops and announced a multibillion-dollar development plan. Bus service has been opened for the first time in 57 years. The Pakistani President has suggested three solutions: Some areas of Kashmir could be made independent or placed under joint Indian-Pakistani control or put under UN administration. However, India has ruled out division along religious lines or redrawing international borders. ",

    "summary": " Pakistan's President Musharraf and India's Prime Minister Singh met for talks in New Delhi in April 2005. Musharraf pronounced the peace process, begun in January 2004, as &quot;irreversible.&quot; India and Pakistan agreed to open bank branches in each other's countries. Trade rose to $600 million in 2005, and they pledged improvement in air and shipping services. They also agreed to notify each other in advance of ballistic missile tests. Prime Minister Singh invited Kashmir's separatists for peace talks, a critical move toward pushing forward the peace process. They had previously been excluded from the talks between India and Pakistan. Despite improved economic and cultural relations, India and Pakistan have made little progress on the problem of Kashmir. However, leaders of both countries remain committed to the peace process. They planned formal talks on the subject in New Delhi on April 17, their first since India's Prime Minister Singh took office last May. On April 16, moderate Kashmiri separatist leaders were to meet with the Pakistani president in New Delhi. In June, they made a historic trip to Pakistan and met with Pakistani government officials. India's Prime Minister Singh invited them for peace talks to be held on September 5. In April 2005 Musharraf came to New Delhi for an India-Pakistan cricket match and his first talks with Singh. Kashmiri moderates in the All Party Hurriyat Conference (APHC) met with Musharraff there and later visited Pakistan. They demand inclusion in the peace process. Indian mediators had been in contact with APHC leaders since their 2004 talks. Some Kashmiri activists in Indian jails have been freed. Singh invited APHC moderates for peace talks September 5th. Singh and Musharraf met September 14th in NY, vowed to pursue peace in Kashmir but produced no major initiatives. India-Pakistan ties have strengthened in other areas. Progress continues to be made in the Indian-Pakistani dispute over Kashmir despite the April killing by suspected Muslim rebels of six Indians, including three policemen. The Pakistani President visited India in April for his first formal talks with the Indian Prime Minister. In June eight moderate separatist leaders from India visited Pakistan. In September the Indian Prime Minister invited separatists for peace talks. On the economic front, India and Pakistan were scheduled to hold joint economic meetings for the first time in 16 years. They are focusing on banking, air and shipping services, customs rules, and regular bus service. ",
