"Ice continues to melt at an alarming rate in both the Arctic and Antarctic .

These changes are threatening the culture and economy of the indigenous Artic population . Ice shelves in Antarctic are collapsing . The melting of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet could raise ocean levels worldwide approximately 15 feet . Increased tourism in Antarctic is having an environmental impact . Researchers are debating whether greenhouse gases or natural climate cycles are the biggest cause of The melting of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet . Collapse of coastal Antarctic ice shelves accelerated eight - fold the seaward flow of inland glaciers , raising sea levels : Larsen A ( 1995 ) , Wilkins ( 1998 ) , Larsen B ( 2002 ) , Larsen C ( this century ) . Currents undermine the Ross and Ronne ice shelves , enabling ice flows from deep within the West Antarctic Ice Sheet . Arctic permafrost thawed ; glaciers and sea ice retreated . In 30 years the Arctic ice area shrank by 10 % , its thickness by 42 % , opening shorter maritime routes when Arctic sea ice disappears in future summers . Siberian lakes disappeared . Indigenous cultures and glacier tourism suffered . Bird migrations shifted . Northern Hemisphere weather will worsen . In Antarctica and the Artic , ice melts are causing complex questions about the impact of global warming . In Antarctica huge glaciers are thinning and ice shelves are either disintegrating or retreating . These findings are possible indications of global warming . Information gathered about Antarctica coincides with a recent report on accelerating climate changes in Arctic . A Chinese scientist predicted that the Artic icecap would melt by 2080 . the indigenous Artic population are fighting global warming because global warming will be a threat to the indigenous Artic population societies , economies and culture . The thinning of glaciers and ice shelves , as well as the softening of the permafrost , has accelerated greatly in recent years . While it is not certain that the man - made greenhouse effect is entirely to blame , it is clear that man must take steps now to address the problem . Global warming affects everything : oil - platforms , the society of peoples who are indiginous to the polar regions , polar animals , migratory birds , lakes ( which are drying up as the permafrost melts ) , and even tourism . As melting cold fresh water enters the salty sea , melting cold fresh water will affect ocean currents and therefore world climate .", "summary_trees": ["# ::snt Ice continues to melt at an alarming

Arctic sea ice area is down 20 % and Arctic sea ice could disappear this century . Thinning sea ice threatens extinction of polar bears . Less ice reflects less sunlight , warming the planet , leading to more ice melt and sea - level rise . Greenland and Antarctic ice shelf melting will double the estimated global sea level rise to 1 meter . Arctic permafrost thaw releases warming greenhouse gases , which will increase permafrost melting up to 11 feet deep by 2100 . Greenland ice fishing season has shortened . Lake areas doubled . Glaciers Sermeg , Sermilik , and Kangerdlugssuag melted faster . Alaska 's Columbia glacier also melted faster . Climate change could thaw the top 11 feet of permafrost in most areas of the Northern Hemisphere by 2100 altering ecosystems across Alaska 's , Canada and Russia according to a US study . If thaw occurs , considerable amounts of greenhouse gases could be released into the atmosphere , which could amplify global warming . However , another researcher disagrees that thaw would be so large . another researcher states that Alaska 's permafrost wo n't melt that fast or deep . A group of countries , which fringe the Artic waters , met to discuss measures to reduce greenhouse emissions . Several international meetings have been held to address the issues of global warming and climate change . There continues to be disagreement on whether or not this is the effect of human activity , although scientists agree that something has changed radically and that there are few other explanations . New satellite photos show that Arctic ice is melting faster than before and that air temperatures are rising sharply . And two explorers working with Greenpeace could not complete a trip from Siberia to the North Pole because of the effects of rising temperatures , including broken ice , strong currents , and heavy rainfall .", "summary_trees": ["# ::snt 23 countries recently met in Greenland to encourage governments to act on global warming instead of arguing .\n(m / meet-03\n      :ARG0 (c / country\n            :quant 23)\n      :time (r / recent)\n      :location (c2 / country\n            :name (n / name\n                  :op1 \"Greenland\"))\n      :purpose (e / encourage-01\n            :ARG0 c\n            :ARG1 (g / government-organization\n                  :ARG0-of (g2 / govern-01))\n            :ARG2 (a / act-02\n                  :ARG0 g\n                  :ARG1 (w / warm-01\n                        :ARG1 (g3 / globe))\n                  :ARG1-of (ii / instead-of-91\n                        :ARG2 (a2 / argue-02\n                              :ARG0 g)))))", "# ::snt Worldwide , countries are agreeing that the U.N.

Most accidents are gas explosions , but fires , floods , and cave - ins also occur . Ignored safety procedures , outdated equipment , and corrupted officials exacerbate the problem . Official responses include shutting down thousands of ill - managed and illegally - run mines , punishing errant owners , issuing new safety regulations and measures , and outlawing local officials from investing in mines .

A federal judge refused to order their daughter 's feeding tube reinserted . President Bush signed died . Florida lawmakers refused to intervene in the Schiavo case . An appeals court and US Circuit court also ruled against Schiavo 's parents . U.S. Supreme Court turned aside the Schiavo case . Schiavo won a malpractice suit concerning Schiavo coma in 1993 . Schiavo first petitioned for feeding tube removal in 1998 . After final tube removal in 2005 , US District Court Judge James Whittemore refused to order reinsertion . Schiavo 's parents appealed to a three - judge federal appeals panel but were rebuffed . Judge Greer issued an injunction keeping the DCF and police away from Schiavo . Courts consistently rejected appeals related to abuse allegations or new medical diagnoses , and efforts to block Schiavo cremation . U.S. Supreme Court again declined involvement . A federal appeals court agreed to consider a new hearing but Schiavo died first . Schiavo died on Thursday 31 March , thirteen days after their daughter 's feeding tube was removed by court order . Schiavo husband has requested an autopsy . In the final two weeks of Schiavo life , at least 47 protestors were arrested and there were numerous appeals to have their daughter 's feeding tube reinserted . Efforts even included a congressional bill to shift jurisdiction from state to federal courts and President Bush rush back from Texas to sign a congressional bill to shift jurisdiction from state to federal courts .

The International Astronomical Union will decide if The recently discovered 2003 UB313 beyond Pluto is a planet . Astronomers have questioned whether Pluto discovered in 1930 is a planet or a Kuiper Belt Object ( KBO ) , one of a belt of comets , asteroids and other objects at the edge of the solar system . Then on July 29 , 2005 Caltech astronomer Michael A. Brown announced discovery of The recently discovered 2003 UB313 beyond Pluto . The question : is The recently discovered 2003 UB313 beyond Pluto the tenth planet or should The recently discovered 2003 UB313 beyond Pluto and Pluto discovered in 1930 both be considered KBOs ? On Sept. 10 , Caltech astronomer Michael A. Brown announced that The recently discovered 2003 UB313 beyond Pluto , has a moon . The discovery of The recently discovered 2003 UB313 beyond Pluto in the Kuiper Belt , will likely rekindle he debate over the definition of & quot;planet.&quot ; Until recently , Pluto discovered in 1930 has been accepted for generations as the ninth planet of the solar system despite Pluto discovered in 1930 small size and long elliptical orbit angled to the orbital plane of the eight & quot;inner&quot ; planets . Like the eight & quot;inner&quot ; planets , Pluto discovered in 1930 is spherical , has an atmosphere and seasons and a moon . If Pluto discovered in 1930 is considered a planet then The recently discovered 2003 UB313 beyond Pluto is also a planet . Other Kuiper Belt Objects might also merit consideration . Pluto discovered in 1930 was named the ninth planet because , though small , Pluto discovered in 1930 is round like other planets , and has an atmosphere , seasons , and moon . Astronomers now debate downgrading Pluto discovered in 1930 to Kuiper Belt Object ( KBO ) because of Pluto discovered in 1930 similarity to other icy bodies orbiting beyond Neptune . KBOs are being accurately studied by the orbiting Spitzer Space Telescope . A possible new planet in 2005 is 2003 UB313 ( 2003 EL61 ) , nicknamed Xena . Spanish astronomers also allege discovery of a new body designated 2003 UB313 which is larger than Pluto with a surface very similar to Pluto . & quot;Planet&quot ; has no official definition . 2003 UB313 ( 2003 EL61 ) , nicknamed Xena is similar to Pluto discovered in 1930 , has a moon , also orbits at an angle , and is twice Pluto discovered in 1930 size .", "summary_trees": ["# ::snt Debate

The diameter of Pluto 's and UB313 is about 1,380 and 1,800 miles respectively and Pluto and UB313 have methane ice on Pluto and UB313 surfaces . Proposed definitions based on size or gravitational pull either include or exclude Pluto and UB313 . The scientific deadlock at the International Astronomical Union will not be resolved quickly . A committee of the International Astronomical Union ( IAU ) is considering the question of planethood of Pluto and UB313 . Pluto and UB313 might be called & quot;minor planets&quot ; or could be considered KBOs . NASA 's Hubble Space telescope strengthened Pluto 's claim to planethood by finding two additional moons around Pluto . On Jan 20 , 2006 NASA 's launched NASA 's New Horizon spacecraft to explore Pluto 's and the Kuiper Belt which its New Horizon spacecraft is scheduled to reach in July 2015 . Meanwhile German astronomers determined that the diameter of UB313 is 1800 miles compared to Pluto 's 1380 . A committee of the International Astronomical Union ( IAU ) continues to deliberate . Debate continues over what constitutes a planet . Some astronomers say a planet should have a diameter greater than 2,000 kilometers ( Pluto and UB313 do ) . Another suggestion is roundness : Another suggestion would include Pluto and UB313 and likely several others yet unknown . Another possible definition is that a planet must gravitationally dominate a planet surroundings , which would exclude Pluto and UB313 . Pluto 's became more interesting when NASA 's Hubble Space telescope discoverd that Pluto 's had not just one but three moons . Scientific interest in Pluto 's and Kuiper Belt objects led to the New Horizons spacecraft mission : a nine year trip to Pluto 's and beyond . Scientists debate redefining & quot;planet&quot ; or retiring & quot;planet&quot . KBO 2003 UB313 , discovered by Michael E. Brown , was confirmed by surface heat emanations to be 30 percent larger than Pluto 's . Both have surface methane ice . If Pluto 's is a planet , UB313 should be too . NASA 's Hubble Space telescope showed two more small moons orbiting Pluto 's , 30 - 100 miles in diameter . Pluto and UB313 , may be a binary planet system orbiting a center mass between Pluto and UB313 . At least four KBOs have known moons . Pluto 's would be the first KBO to have multiple satellites .", "summary_trees": ["# ::snt After 18 months the International Astronomical Union has still not determined the criteria for planethood

A Texas scientist attributed Lance Armstrong performance to Lance Armstrong modern training approach , not the drug EPO . A specialist in the fight against doping in sports , however , suggested that Lance Armstrong had used a range of banned substances . On May 23 , 2005 the French Sports newspaper L'Equipe reported Lance Armstrong illegally used erythropoietin for Tour de France , based on urine samples examined outside World Anti - Doping Agency protocols , but linked to Lance Armstrong by L'Equip , in violation of WADA anonymity rules . Tour Director Leblanc accepted charged uncritically , but discipline seemed unlikely because WADA testing was impossible . The French sports minister agreed . USA Cycling , Miguel Indurain , and Ed Coyle defended Lance Armstrong . Lance Armstrong took erythropoietin during cancer treatments before 1999 . An International Cycling Union investigation of 1999 drug testing is pending . Alessandro Donati suggested without evidence that Lance Armstrong used other banned substances . the French Sports newspaper L'Equipe reported new tests by a French laboratory on backup urine samples Lance Armstrong provided at Tour de France tested positive for the drug EPO . Lance Armstrong strongly denied charged and questioned the validity of new tests by a French laboratory on backup urine samples Lance Armstrong provided at the 1999 Tour de France . USA Cycling , fellow cyclists , scientists and French fans have defended Lance Armstrong . Defenders attacked reported as unethical and the laboratory results as flawed and unsound . Lance Armstrong is suing a British newspaper for printing excerpts from a book which insinuated Lance Armstrong had been doping . An Italian specialist believes Lance Armstrong used other drugs , too . However , Lance Armstrong has never been found guilty of doping . the French Sports newspaper L'Equipe charged Lance Armstrong of using the drug EPO in 1999 to win Lance Armstrong first of seven consecutive Tours . The laboratory conducting new tests by a French laboratory on backup urine samples Lance Armstrong provided at the 1999 Tour de France could n't confirm backup urine samples Lance Armstrong provided at the 1999 Tour de France were Lance Armstrong , but the French Sports newspaper L'Equipe said the French Sports newspaper L'Equipe decoded the labels from samples identifying Lance Armstrong . Lance Armstrong strongly denies charged . The director of UT 's Human Performance Laboratory , who studied Lance Armstrong physiology from 1992 to 1999 , stated that Lance Armstrong record winning streak is explained by Lance Armstrong years

men broke out in a Paris suburb on the night of Oct. 27 , 2005 . Cars were torched , windows smashed , and policemen stoned . On successive nights Rioting by young Muslim men spread to other parts of Paris and then to other cities . Thousands of police have been deployed to little avail . Fortunately casualties have been light . Some rioters blame Rioting by young Muslim men on tough policing policies but Rioting by young Muslim men is more likely caused by frustration of young men who have no work and little hope for the future . On Nov. 8 the French government authorized local authorities to impose curfews . On Oct. 27 , 2005 in a Paris suburb , two youth were electrocuted and one injured hiding in a power substation from police . For 12 days riots reached nearly 300 towns and urban Paris .

An international group is studying an aromatose inhibitor , which may replace tamoxifen . And a Taiwanese - U.S. cooperative effort is developing a new breast - cancer drug . The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ' has undertaken a study of sisters to find genetic and environmental causes of the disease . Other studies are looking into the effects and effectiveness of oral contraceptives , an underactive thyroid , olive oil , a cell 's ability to repair DNA , and the flushing of milk ducts . A new Dutch diagnostic tool could help some breast - cancer patients avoid unnecessary treatment . And advances in technology and techniques have now made radiation safe for breast - cancer patients .", "summary_trees": ["# ::snt New drug SR-13668 curbs AKT retroviral oncogene proteins for breast

Combined chemotherapy and hormone therapy cut death in half within 15 years from recurring breast cancer . Consuming 33.3 fat grams daily reduces breast cancer recurrence 30 % over five years . Exercise increases breast cancer survival 50 % . Low melatonin levels in night - time workers increased breast cancer . Benign & quot;proliferative&quot ; lesions correlate with later breast cancer . At 65 and older , early smaller localized tumors accounted for 96 % of survival improvement ; 38 % under 50 . Herceptin will soon be added to chemotherapy as a standard part of post surgical treatment for some breast cancer patients . Scientists reported that breast cancer patients who follow diets low in fat might reduce the chance that breast cancer patients who follow diets low in fat tumors will return . A study showed that walking for three to five hours per week reduced the risk of death by 50 percent . Another study examining the role of childhood diet plays in breast cancer found an association between eating French fries regularly during the preschool years and developing breast cancer as an adult . Risk of dying from breast cancer fell because drugs prevent recurrence and earlier - detected tumors are smaller . Herceptin halves risk of recurrence in women with tumors high in protein HER2 . A low - fat diet and exercise may reduce chances of recurrence . Only removing the lymph node nearest a cancer is less invasive and accurately detects whether cancer has spread . Low - grade ductal carcinoma in situ has various grades , can be mistaken as benign , and can take 40 years to develop . Night shift workers , women with benign breast lesions , and girls who frequently ate French fries as preschoolers have a higher risk of breast cancer . Breast cancer survival rates have improved because of better screening , leading to detection of smaller tumors when Breast cancer is still localized . There are two new drugs for breast cancer - Herceptin and avastin . Scientists see a link between benign breast cancer lesions and later cancer . Studies have shown that both low - fat diets and exercise can increase survival rates for breast cancer patients . But eating french fries in childhood can lead to cancer in adulthood . Night workers seem to have a higher incidence of breast cancer , indicating that there may be a relationship between tumor developent and exposure to light .", "summary_trees": ["# ::snt Herceptin

At the Kitzmiller vs. Dover Area School District trial , a biochemistry professor at Lehigh and lawyers at the Thomas More Law Center testified for teaching intelligent design as a credible scientific theory .

Both sides agreed to a bench trial without a jury , common in First Amendment cases where arguments are about legal rather than factual issues . At the Kitzmiller vs. Dover Area School District trial , board members said board members wanted to & quot;encourage critical thinking.&quot ; However , the parents presented evidence the board 's purpose was religious and the intelligent design statement was a compromise after board members could not teach creationism . the judge ruled that compelling biology teachers to present intelligent design as an alternative explanation to evolution violates the constitution .

A survey of cell phone records and accidents in Australia conducted by the U.S. based Insurance Institute for Highway Safety concludes that there is little difference between hand - held and hands - free device driver distraction . A survey of cell phone records and accidents in Australia conducted by the U.S. based Insurance Institute for Highway Safety confirms that cell - phone use while driving increases injuries and deaths . The District of Columbia , New York and New Jersey passed legislation that bans using hand - held cell phones while driving . More than 400,000 tickets and warnings have been issued since New York first enacted legislation that bans using hand - held cell phones while driving . New Mexico and Chicago City only allow hands - free cell phone . Texas is considering cell phone laws . An Insurance Institute of Highway Safety survey said using any cell phones while driving is dangerous . Drivers using cell phones are four times as likely to end up in a crash as drivers who did n't use a cell phone . Forty - five countries banned hand - held phone use while driving . In the US only New York , New Jersey and The District of Columbia completely ban hand - held phone use . Some states direct hand - held bans to specific groups such as school bus drivers or those on learner 's permits . Some municipalities have enacted bans but some have been overturned by states declining to take action against cell phone use . Some jurisdictions permit hands - free cell phone use . Cell phone bills in Texas and California failed to carry . Laws are often ignored and enforcement spotty . However , Washington police average 600 tickets and 250 warnings each month . The District of Columbia , NY state , New Jersey , Connecticut and Chicago City ban the use of hand - held cell phones while driving . Some states or cities ban use with learner 's permits , by school bus drivers , by minors for six months after getting minors licenses , or require hands - free phones . Every state has considered restrictions but bills seldom pass . Some states , including Florida , prohibit local governments from restricting cell phone use . Hands - free and hand - held cell phones are equally distracting . Laws are often ignored . Enforcement is spotty .

Connecticut and Chicago have joined New York , New Jersey and DC in prohibiting use of hand - held phones . Many states have put limits on teens using cell phones while teens drive . Enforcement of laws banning cell phone use while driving is a problem . Nearly everyone supports laws banning cell phone use while driving , nearly everyone ignores laws banning cell phone use while driving . the Department of Defense approved restrictions on cell phone use by motorists but left it for the military services and individual bases to decide how to enforce restrictions on cell phone use by motorists . the U.S. Virgin Islands now bans hand - held cell phone use while driving . Eleven states including Colorado , Delaware , Maryland and Tennessee ban cell phone use by young drivers . California prohibits phone use while driving by bus drivers but not others . Under a Pentagon directive , bans on cell phone use while driving are becoming common on military bases . In 2005 , 38 states tried to pass restrictive legislation . Effectiveness is difficult to assess because drivers or witnesses must confirm cell phone use coincided with accidents .

attacks ( conventional explosives or nuclear electromagnetic pulse ) and computer attacks ( external or internal ) against the internet - based supervisory control and data acquisition computers and networks that remotely control power generation and transmission . Recognized cyber - security improvements need to be implemented more comprehensively , especially against documented threats from Al - Qaida , and older , less secure equipment replaced . Network stability and capacity , and ensured power locally , can be improved with on - site power generation that can also increase power available to the network , such as from fuels , solar , wind , and fuel cells . Excess power can be stored as hydrogen . Security experts warned that terrorists could unleash electromagnetic bombs that can be catastrophic . The U.S. is particularly vulnerable because The U.S. relies heavily on telecommunications and electronics . Homeland Security is being urged to set up mechanisms to stop attacks and restore power . Electric company officials have been warned that Electric company officials need to focus more on cyber - security to prevent hackers from attacking U.S. electric power grids . Many nuclear power plants in The U.S. lack sirens warning of a nuclear emergency if electricity also was blacked out . Many analysts believe the biggest threat to the power grid is from companies using older equipment that is more susceptible to attack and their reluctance to update to new computers . Former counterterrorism chief Richard Clarke opined that a sophisticated hacker could probably get into each of the three US power networks and bring down sections . Computers make The U.S. infrastructure more efficient , but Computers also make the nation 's infrastructure more vulnerable . Improved planning and additional power plants would seem to improve reliability and lessen the chance for a widespread blackout like the one in 2003 . Alternative power sources could also benefit . Electrical grid vulnerability has grown as equipment is controlled through the Internet or phone , older equipment becomes susceptible to attack , and electric companies ' cybersecurity remains inadequate . Homeland Security has n't yet assessed cyberattack threats . An electromagnetic pulse could damage electrical power systems . In 2003 , fifty million Americans lost power in a blackout originating in Ohio . New York has improved power grid monitoring and is increasing in - state generation through fuel cells , windmills , and solar panels . Texas protects Texas grid by remaining independent . Terrorist attacks are being simulated using computer models . The 2005 Energy Bill calls for increased energy production and grid modernization .", "summary_trees": ["# ::snt Electric power networks are vulnerable to physical attacks ( conventional explosives or

Croatia and Hungary are considering an Adriatic Sea pipeline to decrease reliance on Russia . The European Union imports some gas from Russia but parts of Europe are mainly Russia dependent . A proposed trans - Caspian pipeline linking gas directly to the West bypassing Russia is causing renewed conflicts . Gazprom intends to remain the leading gas supplier to Europe and to expand Gazprom markets . However , Russia disruption of gas supplies to Europe during freezing weather raised concerns about Russia ability to ensure steady fuel supplies . Pipelines supplying Russian gas go through Ukraine , accused of gas theft , and each country blames the other for the shortage . Croatia and Hungary are weighing construction of a pipeline from Adriatic Sea to bring Middle Eastern gas to Europe and decrease reliance on Russian gas . Russia has opposed a US - backed pipeline project that would bypass Russia and link Central Asian gas fields directly to the West . Faced with mounting criticism , Russia restored gas withheld from Ukraine , accused of gas theft , in an alleged pricing dispute but suspected to be Russia meddling in Ukraine , accused of gas theft , internal politics . Steady fuel supplies from Gazprom became questioned . Austria proposed a gas pipeline from Iran to Austria as part of Nabucco . Gas pipeline explosions in January 2006 were blamed on both Russia and terrorists . Croatia and Hungary are considering a liquified petroleum gas terminal on the Adriatic coast and a pipeline to Europe to decrease reliance on Russian gas . A US - backed trans - Caspian pipeline is proposed that would bring Central Asian gas to Europe and bypass Russia . Russia restored the flow of natural gas through the Ukrainian pipeline in early January because of a pricing dispute . The resulting European energy crisis made European governments question Russia reliability and seek alternative sources . Austria is weighing the construction of a pipeline from Iran through Turkey and the Balkans . Croatia and Hungary are considering a pipeline to bring liquid gas from North Africa and the Middle East . The U.S.supports a proposed pipeline under Adriatic Sea to bring gas from Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan through Azerbaijan , Georgia , and Turkey .

Moderate Republicans sided with President Bush 's while most Democrats and liberal advocacy groups stayed out of the fray . On Oct. 12 , 2005 President Bush 's tried to promote confirmation by vouching for Harriet Miers as an evangelical Christian , but conservatives said the issue was not religion but Harriet Miers lack of qualifications .

Conservatives continued to deride nominated and called for nominated withdrawal . President Bush 's has nominated Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court . nominated must be confirmed by Senate . There is increasingly strong opposition to nominated , with outrage expressed by conservatives such as Pat Buchanan and Charles Krauthammer .
