        "summary": "  On August 23, 2005 the French Sports newspaper L'Equipe charged that Lance Armstrong used the drug EPO in 1999. Armstrong strongly denied the charge. The French sports minister, the Tour de France director and the chief executive of the USCycling said that since the tests used as a basis for the charges were inadequate no action would be taken against the cyclist. A Texas scientist attributed Armstrong's performance to his modern training approach, not EPO. A specialist in the fight against doping in sports, however, suggested that Armstrong had used a range of banned substances.    On May 23, 2005 sports newspaper L'Equip reported Armstrong illegally used erythropoietin for the 1999 Tour de France, based on urine samples examined outside World Anti-Doping Agency protocols, but linked to Armstrong by L'Equip, in violation of WADA anonymity rules. Tour Director Leblanc accepted the charge uncritically, but discipline seemed unlikely because WADA testing was impossible. The French Sports Minister agreed. USA Cycling, Miguel Indurain, and Ed Coyle defended Armstrong. Armstrong took erythropoietin during cancer treatments before 1999. An International Cycling Union investigation of 1999 drug testing is pending. Alessandro Donati suggested without evidence that Armstrong used other banned substances.    French newspaper L'Equipe reported new tests by a French laboratory on backup urine samples Lance Armstrong provided at the 1999 Tour de France tested positive for EPO. Armstrong strongly denied the charges and questioned the validity of the tests. USA Cycling, fellow cyclists, scientists and French fans have defended Armstrong. Defenders attacked the report as unethical and the laboratory results as flawed and unsound. Armstrong is suing a British newspaper for printing excerpts from a book which insinuated he had been doping. An Italian specialist believes Armstrong used other drugs, too. However, he has never been found guilty of doping.    A French newspaper accused Lance Armstrong of using the illegal performance-enhancing drug, EPO in 1999 to win his first of seven consecutive Tours. The laboratory conducting the tests couldn't confirm the samples were Armstrong's, but the newspaper said it decoded the labels from samples identifying Armstrong. Armstrong strongly denies this charge. The director of UT's Human Performance Laboratory, who studied Armstrong's physiology from 1992 to 1999, stated that Armstrong's record winning streak is explained by his years of training and a modest diet in the spring months before the Tour de France. </text> <scu uid=\"2\" label=\"French newspaper L'Equipe charged Lance Armstrong used erythropoietin (EPO) in 1999\">  <contributor

        "summary": "  In November, Colombian police arrested a FARC assassin, the army killed a FARC leader, and the court approved the extradition of a FARC chief to the US to face narcotics trafficking and money laundering charges. FARC rebels murdered four indigenous Indian leaders in less than a week. The government and FARC continued to argue over details of a prisoner swap. The UN urged Colombia to speed up negotiations for hostage release. December 2, the government announced it would pardon 23 FARC members to facilitate reaching a humanitarian accord with FARC. Colombian police may have kidnapped a FARC rebel in Venezuela.     FARC rejected a government proposal to hold talks aimed at exchanging rebels for hostages held by the guerillas. FARC asked the president to grant them the two southern demilitarized zones, before discussions could take place. The government denied their request because it has to guarantee the safety of the people across the country. The United Nations urged hostage release. The rebel groups released 12 hostages. The Columbian government plans to pardon more than 30 members of FARC as they negotiate a prisoner swap.    FARC rejected the government proposal for talks aimed at exchanging jailed rebels for hostages unless two southern counties were demilitarized. The government rejected that demand but released 50 jailed guerillas to build confidence. FARC followed with release of five kidnap victims. FARC killed another indigenous leader, Pervis Pacheco of the Kankuamo Indians and are believed to have killed the leader of Arhuaco Indians. Columbia's Supreme Court approved extradition of a FARC chief, among others, to the US to face charges of narco-trafficking and money laundering. The government was to pardon 23 FARC members as the two sides negotiate prisoner exchanges.    The Colombian government again refused FARC's request for two southern demilitarized zones before prisoner exchange discussions. FARC holds 1600 hostages. Police arrested a top FARC assassin responsible for over 50 assassinations, including a mayor and town councilor, and ordering hostages killed when families failed to pay ransoms. FARC killed four indigenous leaders of the Kankuamo, Yanacona and Arhuaca Indians. The government released 50 jailed guerrillas and pardoned 23. Five FARC rebels died in a clash with the army. Colombia approved extradition of a FARC chief to the US. A FARC leader was seized in Venezuela and moved to Colombia.   </text> <scu uid=\"1\" label=\"Colombian police arrested a FARC assassin\">  <contributor label=\"Colombian police arrested a FARC

        "summary": "  A Russian mini-submarine containing 7 submariners became trapped for 3 days on the sea floor in eastern Russia. The submarine was entangled in fishing nets and/or a coastal monitoring system antenna. Russian rescue attempts to free and raise the submarine were unsuccessful. Russia requested international help. Japan, Britain and the U.S. responded with rescue equipment. The British Navy used a robotic vehicle to free the submarine which then surfaced. The crew were in satisfactory condition and taken for medical examination. Russia's naval equipment has not been upgraded as promised by Putin following the Kursk submarine tragedy.    On Aug. 4, 2005 the Russian navy, working desperately to disengage a small military submarine with seven crew snagged by underwater cables at a depth of 625 feet off the Kamchatka peninsula, called for international help. Japan dispatched four vessels, Britain's Royal Navy sent a submersible Super Scorpio unmanned robotic vehicle and the U. S. Pacific fleet sent two vehicles similar to the British. Estimates varied as to how much oxygen remained for the entrapped crewmen. The British vehicle arrived first and on Aug. 7 the submarine was cut loose and the crewmen were found all alive.    For nearly three days, a Russian mini-submarine was trapped about 600 feet below the surface of the Beryozovaya Bay. The AS-28 became snarled in the cables of an undersea coastal monitoring system. Throughout the ordeal, there were varying estimates of the remaining oxygen supply. When Russian attempts to tow the sub to shallower water failed, they sent out an urgent call for international help. Japan, Britain and the US all dispatched vessels to aid the rescue efforts. A British Super Scorpio robotic underwater vehicle succeeded in freeing the mini-sub. All seven sailors aboard were rescued in satisfactory condition.    A small Russian submarine with seven crew members was trapped on the seabed off the Kamchatka Peninsula late on 4 August. The Russians tried desperately to pull the sub to shallower waters but those efforts failed. They sought international assistance. Japan sent four naval vessels, the U.S. sent three underwater vehicles, but the British were the first to arrive, with remote control submersibles. They cut away the net or undersea cables trapping the sub, enabling it to rise to the surface after almost three days at the bottom. All seven crew members were alive and well. </text> <scu uid=\"1\" label=\"Mini-submarine trapped underwater\">  <contributor label=\"mini-submarine...became trapped...on the sea floor\">   <part

        "summary": "  Charles Taylor disappeared 48 hours after the Nigerian government rescinded his political asylum. Bowing to international pressure the Liberian government was preparing to take Taylor into custody to extradite him to Sierra Leone. United Nations chief Kofi Annan requested West African countries to deny Taylor refuge and arrest him. Taylor was arrested the next day by Nigerian police while attempting to cross the border into Cameroon. Upon his involuntary return to Liberia he was flown by the United Nations peacekeeping force to Sierra Leone and was read the arrest warrant. Taylor will appear before the Special Court on April 3.    On the night of March 27, 2006 Charles Taylor vanished. His spiritual advisor said he was hiding somewhere in West Africa. On March 29 Taylor was arrested while attempting to cross over into Cameroon. He was detained under armed guard and then placed on a presidential jet bound for Liberia. He left Monrovia, Liberia an hour after arrival on a UN helicopter to Freetown, Sierra Leone where he was delivered to the UN-backed Special Court for Sierra Leone. He was due to make his first court appearance on April 3 at 3 p.m.    Taylor vanished the night of March 27, after the Nigerian government said it would end his asylum and allow him to face indictment by an international court in Sierra Leone. On March 29 he was arrested by Nigeria police trying to escape into Cameroon. He was detained under guard, flown to Liberia, arrested by UN peacekeeping forces, and extradited by helicopter to Sierra Leone on March 30. The Special Court in Sierra Leon indicted Taylor on 11 counts of crimes against humanity, making him the first African head of state to face an international war crimes tribunal.    Taylor vanished two days after President Obasanjo said Liberia could take Taylor into custody. Nigerian police arrested Taylor a day after his escape, as he tried to cross into Cameroon with sacksful of dollars and euros. He was detained under armed guard in a military camp before being put in handcuffs on a presidential jet Wednesday bound for Liberia. An hour after arrival he left for Sierra Leone aboard a UN helicopter. He was to make his first court appearance on Monday, April 3, 2006, the first African head of state to face an international war crimes tribunal. </text> <scu uid=\"105\" label=\"Taylor became the

        "summary": "  The directors of Fannie met on Dec. 19 to decide Raines' fate, but the meeting concluded without any announcement of a decision. On Dec. 21 Raines resigned with his departure structured as an early retirement. The directors' decision in favor of Raines' retirement rather than dismissal would reap him $8.7 million in deferred payments and an annual pension of more than $1 million. On Jan. 21, 2005, however, Fannie announced that Raines would be denied the cash bonus that he would have received for 2004.    By October 12, 2004 the U.S. Attorney's Office in Washington was investigating Fannie Mae CEO Franklin Raines, who denied wrongdoing, after a caustic September 22 Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight report vetted by the SEC, charged that Fannie Mae violated Financial Accounting Standard 133 and FAS-91, inflating Fannie Mae's reported net earnings by $9 billion, so that Raines and other top executives received maximum bonuses of $27.1 million vice no bonuses, and got higher, allegedly manipulated, prices for their own sales of Fannie Mae stock. The Justice Department told Fannie Mae to preserve documents related to OFHEO's report.    Raines testified to Congress that he expected to be held accountable if his interpretation of the accounting rules was not accepted. The chief accountant of the SEC ruled that Fannie Mae violated accounting standards overstating its profits by 38 percent since January 2001. Raines is seeking a vote of confidence from the directors as he struggles to survive criminal investigation. Raines retired under pressure from federal regulators. Raines will be denied bonuses for 2004 as Fannie Mae eliminated bonuses for top executives.    The SEC ruled that Fannie Mae had overstated its profits by 38 per cent in the years 2001-2004. The OFHEO held Raines responsible the company's emphasisis on earnings over accuracy and demanded significant changes in senior management. On 21 December, Raines took early retirement with millions of dollars in benefits and stock, plus an annual pension of over one million dollars. The company still faced a Justice Department criminal investigation, an SEC civil investigation, further OFHEO examination of its accounting, and several class-action lawsuits. As of 21 January, Fannie Mae was withholding millions in bonuses for top executives. </text> <scu uid=\"1\" label=\"The directors of Fannie met on Dec. 19 to decide Raines' fate\">  <contributor

Innovative bamboo products include: hardwood flooring, paneling, cabinets, countertops, utensils, plates, bowls, cutting boards, shower curtains, and products based on fiber, fiber pulps or veneers. Bamboo's has greater tensile strength than steel. It can be harvested every 3 to 5 years, but entire bamboo stands die-off every 60 years, threatening crop collapse and endangering China's endangered Giant Pandas, who are dependent on arrow bamboo.    Bamboo has many uses. In the home, it is used for flooring, kitchen cabinets, counter tops, and chairs. India is allowing its islands that were struck by the tsunami, to build makeshift houses from bamboo and other woods, which can withstand quakes. Ethiopia hopes to optimize ways of producing bamboo to reduce poverty. Large areas of arrow bamboo provide food for giant pandas in northwest China. Now they are suffering from hunger because large tracts of arrow bamboo died. It takes 10-15 years for new plants to grow.     Bamboo is increasing used for household items and furniture. Its main use remains as a sturdy alternative for hardwood flooring. It has greater tensile strength than steel and costs less and lasts longer than oak flooring. It is environmentally friendly and sustainable since it grows fast and can be harvested within five years. Bamboo shoots are a traditional part of Asian cuisine but must be properly prepared to avoid causing harm. The bamboo plant is the staple panda food. But when the plant flowers and produces seeds, pandas will not eat it and are in danger of starving.    Bamboo is used for flooring, paneling, and furnishings. Its tensile strength is greater than steel, it's harvestable in 3-5 years, and it's inexpensive. India makes bamboo housing for earthquake survivors. Ethiopia is developing its extensive bamboo commercially with China's help. A pulp mill for bamboo-like Arundo donax would benefit Alabama economically but residents fear the plant's invasiveness. California imported it for windbreaks. Giant pandas are increasing in China due to expanded bamboo forests and moving pandas when local bamboo flowers and becomes inedible. KFC in China substitutes bamboo shoots for coleslaw. Incorrect preparation of fresh shoots risks hydrogen cyanide exposure. </text> <scu uid=\"1\" label=\"Bamboo is increasingly used for household items and furniture\">  <contributor label=\"Bamboo is

        "summary": "  Specialists in several countries confirmed that Viktor Yushchenko was deliberately poisoned with pure TCDD, a lethal form of dioxin which causes disfigurement and long term health issues. The poisoning investigation is ongoing. The earlier disputed presidential election was declared fraudulent and invalid by the Supreme Court. A repeat election was mandated. Foreign observers will help secure an honest election. Yushchenko was elected president of the Ukraine with 51.99 percent of the vote. As he took the oath of office Yushchenko vowed to improve economic conditions in the Ukraine. Viktor Yanukovych vowed to appeal the election results to the Supreme Court.    The Ukraine Supreme Court invalidated the November 21 election, due to election fraud. Yushchenko's ingested poison was identified as pure TCDD, a rare highly toxic form of Dioxin. Yushchenko deferred criminal investigations until after the repeat election December 26. Parliament failed to pass Yuschenko's election reforms, but the Constitutional Court ruled for expanded home voting, which helped Yushchenko. Yushchenko supporters pushed for Yanukovich's resignation; instead he took a leave of absence to run his campaign. The dual U.S.-Ukraine citizen Yushchenko won the Presidency 51.99% to 44.20% for Yanukovich. Yanukovich said he would appeal to the Supreme Court, without much hope.    In December, doctors determined conclusively that Yushchenko was deliberately poisoned with the most lethal form of dioxin. Prosecutors reopened a criminal investigation into his attempted murder. Yushchenko was sure that Ukrainian authorities were responsible. He fell ill on September 6, after having food and drinks with the head of the Security Service of Ukraine and others. The Ukraine Supreme Court overturned the November runoff election results due to fraud, and Parliament enacted new anti-fraud election reforms in December. Yushchenko won a repeat runoff on December 26 and took office in January, his face still disfigured by the poison.    Yushchenko was sworn in as President of Ukraine on Sunday 23 January. In a third round of voting on 26 December, Yushchenko won 51.99% of the vote to Yanukovich's 44.20%. The Supreme Court had annulled the results of the second round of voting because of election fraud. That decision followed 17 days of massive popular protests called the &quot;Orange Revolution&quot; after Yushchenko's campaign color. Doctors confirmed that Yushchenko had been deliberately poisoned with TCDD, the most lethal form of dioxin. Blood tests revealed levels of dioxin &quot;more than 1000 times&quot; normal. Yushchenko will need treatment for months if not years. </text> <scu uid=\"40\" label=\"Yushchenko poisoned with TCDD (dioxin)\">  <contributor label=\"Specialists...confirmed...Yushchenko was

        "summary": "  On June 29, 2005 the Canadian House of Commons passed legislation to legalize gay marriage on a national basis. In Britain a Civil Partnership Act took effect on Dec. 5, 2005 granting some legal rights and tax benefits to gay couples. By March 2006 homosexual rights advocates were demonstrating in favor of gay marriage in Taipei, Taiwan. In the U.S. a Maryland judge threw out a law banning gay marriage, lawmakers in New Hampshire defeated a proposed constitutional amendment banning gay marriage, and seven states were prepared to vote on such amendments in November.    Texas legislators will vote on a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage that is not expected to pass. New Hampshire lawmakers defeated a constitutional ban on gay marriage. The issue is under debate in courts in Maryland, California, New Jersey, New York and Washington State. The US government does not recognize same-sex marriage. Massachusetts is the only state to legalize it, although Vermont and Connecticut allow legalized civil unions. Canada passed landmark legislation to legalize gay marriage everywhere in the country. However, gay marriage is not legal in Sweden and Taiwan. Many countries have legalized civil unions, but not gay marriage.    Canada passed legislation authorizing gay marriages and granting same-sex couples legal rights equal to those in traditional unions. In Sweden, civil unions between homosexuals are legal and the government will decide if the law should be changed to include marriage. Under the Civil Partnership Act passed in Britain, homosexual couples will have the same rights as heterosexual couples. Texas legislation to amend the constitution to ban same-sex marriages is being discussed. Homosexual rights activists urged the Taiwan government to grant homosexual couples the right to marry.    Canada and Spain legalized gay marriage and Britain allowed civil partnerships in 2005. Germany and Switzerland allow registered partnerships. Portugal recognizes de facto couples regardless of sex. Croatia gives gay couples rights equal to de facto heterosexual couples. New Zealand gives them rights equal to married couples. South Africa allows gay couple adoptions. Sweden's Lutheran Church approved gay partnership blessing ceremonies. California, New Jersey, Maine and Hawaii recognize limited forms of gay partnership. State bans on gay unions were rejected by a judge in Maryland and blocked by eleven senators in Texas. Idaho passed a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage. </text> <scu uid=\"74\" label=\"Canada legalized gay marriage\">  <contributor label=\"Canada...legalized gay marriage\">   <part label=\"Canada\" start=\"2053\" end=\"2059\"/>   <part label=\"legalized gay marriage\" start=\"2070\" end=\"2092\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"Canada passed legislation authorizing gay marriages and granting same-sex couples legal rights equal to those in traditional unions\">   <part label=\"Canada passed legislation authorizing gay marriages and granting same-sex couples legal rights equal to those in traditional unions\" start=\"1413\" end=\"1544\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"Canada passed landmark legislation to legalize gay marriage everywhere in the country\">   <part label=\"Canada passed landmark legislation to legalize gay marriage everywhere in the country\" start=\"1146\" end=\"1231\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"On June 29, 2005 the Canadian House of Commons passed legislation to legalize gay marriage on a national basis\">   <part label=\"On June 29, 2005 the Canadian House of Commons passed legislation to legalize gay marriage on a national basis\" start=\"61\" end=\"171\"/>  </contributor> </scu> <scu uid=\"75\" label=\"Spain legalized gay marriage\">  <contributor label=\"Spain legalized gay marriage\">   <part label=\"Spain legalized gay marriage\" start=\"2064\" end=\"2092\"/>  </contributor> </scu> <scu uid=\"81\" label=\"Massachusetts legalized gay marriage\">  <contributor label=\"Massachusetts is the only state to legalize it\">   <part label=\"Massachusetts is the only state to legalize it\" start=\"1035\" end=\"1081\"/>  </contributor> </scu> <scu uid=\"77\" label=\"Maryland rejected a ban on gay unions \">  <contributor label=\"State bans on gay unions were rejected by a judge in Maryland\">   <part label=\"State bans on gay unions were rejected by a judge in Maryland\" start=\"2579\" end=\"2640\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"In the U.S. a Maryland judge threw out a law banning gay marriage\">   <part label=\"In the U.S. a Maryland judge threw out a law banning gay marriage\" start=\"401\" end=\"466\"/>  </contributor> </scu> <scu uid=\"86\" label=\"New Hampshire rejected a ban on gay marriage\">  <contributor label=\"New Hampshire lawmakers defeated a constitutional ban on gay marriage\">   <part label=\"New Hampshire lawmakers defeated a constitutional ban on gay marriage\" start=\"804\" end=\"873\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"lawmakers in New Hampshire defeated a proposed constitutional amendment banning gay marriage\">   <part label=\"lawmakers in New Hampshire defeated a proposed constitutional amendment banning gay marriage\" start=\"468\" end=\"560\"/>  </contributor> </scu> <scu uid=\"78\" label=\"Sweden's church allows gay partnership blessing ceremonies\">  <contributor label=\"Sweden's Lutheran Church approved gay partnership blessing ceremonies\">   <part label=\"Sweden's Lutheran Church approved gay partnership blessing ceremonies\" start=\"2423\" end=\"2492\"/>  </contributor> </scu> <scu uid=\"79\" label=\"Some countries have legalized gay civil unions/partnerships\">  <contributor label=\"Many countries have legalized civil unions\">   <part label=\"Many countries have legalized civil unions\" start=\"1290\" end=\"1332\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"Sweden, civil unions between homosexuals are legal...and the government will decide if the law should be changed to include marriage...Under the Civil Partnership Act passed in Britain, homosexual couples will have the same rights as heterosexual couples\">   <part label=\"Sweden, civil unions between homosexuals are legal\" start=\"1549\" end=\"1599\"/>   <part label=\"Under the Civil Partnership Act passed in Britain, homosexual couples will have the same rights as heterosexual couples\" start=\"1681\" end=\"1800\"/>   <part label=\"and the government will decide if the law should be changed to include marriage\" start=\"1600\" end=\"1679\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"Britain allowed civil partnerships in 2005.

        "summary": "  Prominent award-winning Turkish novelist Orhan Pamuk was indicted for insulting the Turkish identity by comments he made to a Swiss reporter about one million Armenians massacred in Turkey during World War I. He could face up to three years in prison. The US and EU called on Turkey to drop the charges. His December 16 trial was suspended until February 7 because the court lacked a justice ministry order to proceed. The case has stirred outrage across Europe. EU officials were there to observe the trial, the outcome of which could damage the Turkey's chances of joining the EU.    Prominent Turkish novelist, Orhan Pamuk, was indicted over controversial remarks about the Armenian massacres. Pamuk is charged under Turkey's penal code which carries a jail term of more than three years for a person who &quot;explicitly insults&quot; the Turkish republic. The European Union (EU) warned Turkey that its prosecution of Pamuk could damage its chance of joining the EU and is a test of Turkey's commitment to freedom of expression and reforms in its law. European countries, U.S. and activist organizations have criticized Turkey's lack of democratic principles and citizen's rights.     In a Swiss newspaper interview, Turkish novelist Orhan Pamuk said Turkey deliberately killed one million Armenians during WWI, triggering public outrage. He was indicted under Turkey's revised penal code for &quot;public denigration of the Turkish identity,&quot; carrying up to 3 years in jail. Turkey says the deaths were fewer and from civil unrest, not genocide. The US, European Union, and activist organizations criticized Turkey's criminal charges for freedom of expression. The EU said Pamuk's trial would affect Turkey's EU bid. A Turkish court ruled Pamuk should be tried under old laws requiring justice ministry direct order and postponed the trial.    Orhan Pamuk went to court on 16 December for outspoken comments made during a Swiss newspaper interview about the Armenian massacres. The EU warned that the trial could affect Turkey's EU accession process because it would indicate the strength of Turkey's commitment to recent reforms guaranteeing freedom of expression. The EU Enlargement Commissioner said, &quot;It is not Orhan Pamuk who will stand trial, but Turkey.&quot; The trial was suspended until 7 February pending a decision from the Justice Ministry. The offense had been made before the new penal code had gone into effect and therefore came under the old law. </text> <scu uid=\"33\" label=\"Orhan Pamuk made contoversial comments.\">  <contributor

        "summary": "  Rader confessed to six killings on the day of his arrest, but police revealed little detail. There was much public speculation and some media reports of possible links between Rader and BTK including talk of a computer disc and DNA evidence, but investigators remained tight-lipped. On March 1 Rader was charged with 10 murders with bail set at $10 million. On April 19 Rader waived his right to a preliminary hearing at which the prosecution would explain how the police had tied Rader to the killings. This, as the DA said, &quot;prolongs the agony of the public to know.&quot;    Rader's daughter did not turn her father in to police. Wichita investigators continue examining other killings, for possible linkage to BTK. Reportedly, DNA from Rader's daughter facilitated his identification. A computer disk in Rader's final mailing linked to his church. On March 31 Rader was charged with 10 first-degree murders. Bail was $10 million. His next court appearance was March 15. Rader waived his April 19 preliminary hearing. He would plead not guilty at arraignment May 3, and not plead insanity or plea bargain. Rader is no longer secluded from other prisoners. Kansas expected to pay $405,000 for Rader's defense.    Evidence identifying Dennis Rader as the BTK killer was found on a computer disk he mailed to a television station on February 16. Experts linked the disk to a computer at Christ Lutheran Church, where he served as the church council's president. Rader broke his 25-year silence after the Wichita Eagle published an article marking the 30th anniversary of the first BTK killings. Prosecutors cannot yet present their evidence against Rader because he waived his right to a preliminary hearing. Nearby law enforcement agencies are reinvestigating cold cases that bear similarities to the BTK slayings.    Investigators continue to examine unsolved killings over the last 31 years to determine if any can be linked to BTK. Prosecutors cannot seek the death penalty for Rader since the killings occurred before its enactment. For three decades, BTK had toyed with Wichita in letters, poems and packages. It was his most recent mailing to a TV station that helped crack the case: a computer disk traced to the computer at Rader's church. The disk along with DNA evidence led to Rader. Rader waived his right to a preliminary hearing and is expected to plead not guilty. </text> <scu uid=\"2\" label=\"Rader waived his April 19 preliminary hearing\">  <contributor label=\"Rader waived

        "summary": "  Conflicts continue between the separatist regions and Georgia. Peace processes are being disrupted by kidnappings and the suspicious accidental death of Prime Minister Zhvania as he was seeking a negotiated settlement. Saakashvili met with President Bush to discuss Georgian plans to resolve the separatist conflicts. Saakashvili and Moldovan President Voronin criticized the separatists in ex-Soviet republics. They are joining forces to seek solutions. Saakashvili calls for a new Yalta conference to consolidate democracy in Georgia and other countries. Georgian and Abkhazia separatist officials continue to negotiate peace overseen by United Nations monitors. The separatist regions still firmly maintain their independence.    On Jan. 19, 2005 South Ossetians abducted two Georgian police officers in an attempt to disrupt any peace talks. In Abkhazia the new elected president pledged to fight on for international recognition of its de facto independence. On Jan. 26 Saakashvili's offer of autonomy was immediately rejected by South Ossetia. Saakashvili then turned to the international scene presenting Georgia as a force for liberty and freedom as opposed to the separatist regions which &quot;are the last razor-sharp splinters of the Soviet Empire.&quot; As of May 2005 Abkhazia and South Ossetia were still independent from Georgia.    Georgia refused to exchange Ossetian prisoners for Georgians captured by South Ossetia. Saakashvili asked Russia to help reunite South Ossetia and Abkhazia with Georgia. He told the Council of Europe that autonomy for South Ossetia and Abkhazia would comprise &quot;a local government elected freely and directly, that would include an executive branch and a parliament&quot;. Georgia and Moldovia issued a joint declaration against separatist movements. Saakashvili called for a &quot;new Yalta conference&quot;, to extend &quot;liberty&quot; throughout the Black Sea region. Georgia and Abkhazia met with a UN envoy to form a joint group to manage mine removal and ceasefire violations.    Saakashvili told European parliamentarians he would give more independence to separatist regions, as long as Georgia remains whole. South Ossetia immediately rejected his offer of autonomy. Peace talks broke down when two Georgian police officers were abducted and 12 Ossetians were abducted in response. Georgian and Abkhazian officials met with a UN envoy to discuss security issues and agreed to meet again in mid-June. Saakashvili discussed the issue with President Bush. He called for a new Yalta conference to extend the rule of liberty throughout the Black Sea region. Saakashvili and the Moldovan president issued a joint declaration against separatism. </text> <scu uid=\"1\" label=\"Conflicts continue between the separatist regions and Georgia\">  <contributor

The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences' Sisters Study for breast cancer compares shared genes. Arimidex and Aromasin appear to sharply reduce breast cancer occurrence or metastasis. Oleic acid dramatically cuts expression of breast cancer precursor gene Her-2/neu and amplifies Herceptin. DNA repair deficiency strongly associates with susceptibility to breast cancer. Hypothyroidism apparently lessens chances of developing aggressive forms of breast cancer. Modern radiation therapy likely does not increase heart disease risk. Oral contraceptives likely do not increase the risk of BRAC1-associated breast cancer.    The National Health Research Institute and a pharmaceutical company are testing two medications that can treat breast cancer. One drug can curb a protein active in cancer patients and the other is less likely to trigger cardiovascular disease. A new U.S. Sister Study will investigate genetic and environmental causes of breast cancer. A new drug, aromatase inhibitor, appears to sharply reduce the chances of developing cancer in the other breast. Researchers say that olive oil may help fight breast cancer. Oral contraceptives may reduce the risk of breast cancer in high-risk groups.     Developmental drug SR-13668 curbs the oncogene protein AKT, prevalent in cancer patients; and SR-16158 reduces breast cancer patient heart disease risk. Aromatase inhibitors lessen breast cancer recurrence with fewer side effects than tamoxifen. Radiation therapy no longer carries heart disease risk. Olive oil suppresses oncogene Her-2/neu and boosts effectiveness of antibody Herceptin. Hypothyroidism and oral contraceptives reduce breast cancer risk. Sisters are being studied to investigate environmental and genetic affects on cancer risk. Deficiency in cell DNA repair-ability accelerates genetic changes leading to cancer. Protein markers in genes help predict cancer recurrence. Ductal lavage proved unreliable for detecting early cancer.    An international group is studying an aromatose inhibitor, which may replace tamoxifin. And a Taiwanese-U.S. cooperative effort is developing a new breast-cancer drug. NIH has undertaken a study of sisters to find genetic and environmental causes of the disease. Other studies are looking into the effects and effectiveness of oral contraceptives, an underactive thyroid, olive oil, a cell's ability to repair DNA, and the flushing of milk ducts. A new Dutch diagnostic tool could help some breast-cancer patients avoid unnecessary treatment. And advances in technology and techniques have now made radiation safe for breast-cancer patients. </text> <scu uid=\"1\" label=\"New drug SR-13668 curbs oncogene proteins in cancer patients\">

        "summary": "  Electric power networks are vulnerable to physical attacks (conventional explosives or nuclear electromagnetic pulse) and computer attacks (external or internal) against the internet-based supervisory control and data acquisition computers and networks that remotely control power generation and transmission. Recognized cyber-security improvements need to be implemented more comprehensively, especially against documented threats from Al-Qaida, and older, less secure equipment replaced. Network stability and capacity, and ensured power locally, can be improved with on-site power generation that can also increase power available to the network, such as from fuels, solar, wind, and fuel cells. Excess power can be stored as hydrogen.    Security experts warned that terrorists could unleash electromagnetic bombs that can be catastrophic. The U.S. is particularly vulnerable because it relies heavily on telecommunications and electronics. Homeland Security is being urged to set up mechanisms to stop attacks and restore power. Electric company officials have been warned that they need to focus more on cyber-security to prevent hackers from attacking U.S. electric power grids. Many nuclear power plants in the U.S. lack sirens warning of a nuclear emergency if electricity also was blacked out.     Many analysts believe the biggest threat to the power grid is from companies using older equipment that is more susceptible to attack and their reluctance to update to new computers. Former counterterrorism chief Richard Clarke opined that a sophisticated hacker could probably get into each of the three US power networks and bring down sections. Computers make the nation's infrastructure more efficient, but they also make it more vulnerable. Improved planning and additional power plants would seem to improve reliability and lessen the chance for a widespread blackout like the one in 2003. Alternative power sources could also benefit.    Electrical grid vulnerability has grown as equipment is controlled through the Internet or phone, older equipment becomes susceptible to attack, and electric companies' cybersecurity remains inadequate. Homeland Security hasn't yet assessed cyberattack threats. An electromagnetic pulse could damage electrical power systems. In 2003, fifty million Americans lost power in a blackout originating in Ohio. New York has improved power grid monitoring and is increasing in-state generation through fuel cells, windmills, and solar panels. Texas protects its grid by remaining independent. Terrorist attacks are being simulated using computer models. The 2005 Energy Bill calls for increased energy production and grid modernization. </text> <scu uid=\"1\" label=\"Electrical grid control by telecommunications (internet, phone) increases

        "summary": "  Special Prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald is investigating who leaked to the press that Valerie Plame, wife of former Ambassador Joseph Wilson, was an undercover CIA agent. Wilson was a critic of the Bush administration. Administration staffers Karl Rove and I. Lewis Libby are the focus of the investigation. NY Times correspondent Judith Miller was jailed for 85 days for refusing to testify about Libby. Libby was eventually indicted on five counts: 2 false statements, 1 obstruction of justice, 2 perjury. Libby resigned immediately. He faces 30 years in prison and a fine of $1.25 million if convicted. Libby pleaded not guilty.     On October 28, 2005 Lewis Libby was indicted on two counts of making false statements, two perjury counts and obstruction of justice, by Special Prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald's investigation into possible intentional, illegal revelation of the identify of CIA covert operative Valerie Plame. Libby's testimony was contradicted by several witnesses. No others were indicted as the grand jury was extended and Karl Rove remains under investigation. Libby will fight the charges, which have maximum penalties of 30 years and $1.25 million. Judith Miller had been jailed 85 days before testifying and surrendering notes, after Libby formally rescinded their confidential source agreement.    Special prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald's investigation into the naming of Valerie Plame as an undercover CIA agent has led to a parade of newspersons and White House staffers before the Grand Jury. Columnist Robert Novak first revealed Plame, whose husband, former Ambassador Joseph Wilson had contradicted one of President Bush's justifications for war against Iraq. New York Times reporter Judith Miller was jailed 85 days for refusing to testify about Lewis &quot;Scooter&quot; Libby, Vice President's Staff Chief. WH Deputy Chief of Staff Karl Rove is under investigation. Libby resigned after being indicted on five felony counts. He has pled not guilty.    After a nearly two-year investigation in the CIA leak case, Lewis 'Scooter' Libby, Vice-President Cheney's chief of staff, was indicted on felony charges of perjury, making false statements to FBI agents, and obstruction of justice for impeding a federal grand jury. Libby resigned immediately. If convicted, he faces a maximum of 30 years in prison and a 1.25 million dollar fine. He said he plans to fight the charges. Karl Rove, President Bush's deputy chief of staff and close political advisor, was not indicted but still faces the possibility of prosecution as the investigation continues. </text> <scu uid=\"7\" label=\"Valerie Plame is the wife of former Ambassador Joseph Wilson\">  <contributor label=\"Valerie Plame, wife of former Ambassador Joseph Wilson\">   <part label=\"Valerie Plame, wife of former Ambassador Joseph Wilson\" start=\"145\" end=\"199\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"Plame, whose husband, former Ambassador Joseph Wilson\">   <part label=\"Plame, whose husband, former Ambassador Joseph Wilson\" start=\"1726\" end=\"1779\"/>  </contributor> </scu> <scu uid=\"9\" label=\"Special Prosecutor Fitzgerald is investigating who leaked to the press that Valerie Plame was an undercover/covert CIA Agent\">  <contributor label=\"Special Prosecutor...Patrick...Fitzgerald is investigating who leaked...to the press...that Valerie Plame...was an undercover CIA agent\">   <part label=\"Fitzgerald is investigating who leaked\" start=\"88\" end=\"126\"/>   <part label=\"that Valerie Plame\" start=\"140\" end=\"158\"/>   <part label=\"was an undercover CIA agent\" start=\"201\" end=\"228\"/>   <part label=\"Patrick\" start=\"80\" end=\"87\"/>   <part label=\"to the press\" start=\"127\" end=\"139\"/>   <part label=\"Special Prosecutor\" start=\"61\" end=\"79\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"Special Prosecutor...Patrick...Fitzgerald's investigation into...illegal...revelation of the identify of CIA covert operative Valerie Plame\">   <part label=\"Fitzgerald's investigation into\" start=\"913\" end=\"944\"/>   <part label=\"revelation of the identify of CIA covert operative Valerie Plame\" start=\"975\" end=\"1039\"/>   <part label=\"Patrick\" start=\"905\" end=\"912\"/>   <part label=\"illegal\" start=\"967\" end=\"974\"/>   <part label=\"Special Prosecutor\" start=\"886\" end=\"904\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"Special prosecutor...Patrick...Fitzgerald's investigation into the naming of Valerie Plame as an undercover CIA agent\">   <part label=\"Fitzgerald's investigation into the naming of Valerie Plame as an undercover CIA agent\" start=\"1518\" end=\"1604\"/>   <part label=\"Patrick\" start=\"1510\" end=\"1517\"/>   <part label=\"Special prosecutor\" start=\"1491\" end=\"1509\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"investigation in the CIA leak case\">   <part label=\"investigation in the CIA leak case\" start=\"2221\" end=\"2255\"/>  </contributor> </scu> <scu uid=\"11\" label=\"Wilson was a critic of the Bush administration\">  <contributor label=\"Ambassador Joseph...Wilson was a critic of the Bush administration\">   <part label=\"Wilson was a critic of the Bush administration\" start=\"230\" end=\"276\"/>   <part label=\"Ambassador Joseph\" start=\"175\" end=\"192\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"Ambassador Joseph Wilson had contradicted...President Bush's...justifications for war against Iraq\">   <part label=\"Ambassador Joseph Wilson had contradicted\" start=\"1755\" end=\"1796\"/>   <part label=\"President Bush's\" start=\"1804\" end=\"1820\"/>   <part label=\"justifications for war against Iraq\" start=\"1821\" end=\"1856\"/>  </contributor> </scu> <scu uid=\"13\" label=\"Karl Rove is a focus of the investigation\">  <contributor label=\"Karl Rove...are the focus of the investigation\">   <part label=\"Karl Rove\" start=\"302\" end=\"311\"/>   <part label=\"are the focus of the investigation\" start=\"331\" end=\"365\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"Karl Rove remains under investigation\">   <part label=\"Karl Rove remains under investigation\" start=\"1157\" end=\"1194\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"Karl Rove is under investigation\">   <part label=\"Karl Rove is under investigation\" start=\"2023\" end=\"2055\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"Karl Rove...investigation continues\">   <part label=\"Karl Rove\" start=\"2618\" end=\"2627\"/>   <part label=\"investigation continues\" start=\"2768\" end=\"2791\"/>  </contributor> </scu> <scu uid=\"14\" label=\"I.

        "summary": "  India successfully launched two satellites from one rocket for the first time. To decrease costs and increase launches, India developed a universal launch pad for all future vehicles. India will host two international space conferences (planetary exploration and space law). India has signed an agreement with the European Space Agency and is talking with NASA regarding their participation in India's unmanned lunar launch. India's launch of the INSAT-4A has been delayed by the European Space Agency. Boeing cancelled their agreement with India to jointly produce communication satellites. India and Russia are collaborating on the development of a youth communication satellite.    For the first time, India is set to launch two satellites in a single mission. One is for mapping and the other for communications. India will host twin international conferences on planetary exploration and space law. Some 225 delegates including many from the US, China, Japan, Canada, France, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Indonesia will attend. The ISRO announced the payloads from the US, Bulgaria, Germany and Britain for the Chandrayaan-1 mission. Launch of the Indian INSAT-4A communications satellite from French Guyana has been delayed. India and Russia are working on a satellite for communication between youths of the two countries.    India's space program began in 1972. It aspires to be a major space power. India developed a unique universal launching pad and plans a sophisticated propellant plant for its launch vehicle, delayed by sanctions following India's 1998 nuclear testing. India has launched eleven remote-sensing satellites and two satellites in one mission. Communication satellites include Hamsat for Ham radio and distance-learning Edusat. India and Russia plan a youth communication satellite. In 2005 ISRO hosted international conferences on planetary exploration and space law. Europe's Ariane program problems delayed launch of India's telecast and communication satellite INSAT-4A. Boeing withdrew from Indian satellite cooperation.     The Indian Prime Minister has criticized economic sanctions imposed after the 1998 nuclear weapons tests, but noted that these have not hindered India's scientific progress. India launched one rocket carrying two satellites, one for more detailed mapping, the other for home radio operators. Its first unmanned moon mission, scheduled for 2007-2008, will carry three European payloads and perhaps one U.S. payload. Meanwhile India is working with Russia to develop a satellite to enable youths in the two countries to communicate. It will host twin international conferences on planetary exploration and space law for about 225 delegates in June.  </text> <scu uid=\"1\" label=\"India successfully launched two satellites from one

        "summary": "  Congress passed and President Bush signed emergency legislation allowing federal review of the Schiavo case. Schiavo's parents hope to override state rulings and have their daughter's feeding tube reinserted. Federal judges refused to reverse the Florida court's ruling. Florida lawmakers refused to re-enter the case after the federal ruling. A Florida court will hear new motions per Governor Bush. However the parents' appeals for reinsertion of the feeding tube were denied. After prolonged legal debates including unprecedented Congressional intervention and five U.S. Supreme Court appeals, Terri Schiavo died 18 days after her feeding tube was removed.    Terri Schiavo died 13 days after her feeding tube was removed by order of a Florida state court judge. Her parents continued to fight to keep their daughter alive. A federal judge refused to order Terri Schiavo's feeding tube reinserted. President Bush signed an unprecedented law to avert her death. Florida lawmakers refused to intervene in her case. An appeals court and US Circuit court also ruled against her family. The US Supreme court turned aside the case of Terri Schiavo.    Michael Schiavo won a malpractice suit concerning Terri's coma in 1993. He first petitioned for feeding tube removal in 1998. After final tube removal in 2005, US District Court Judge James Whittemore refused to order reinsertion. The parents appealed to a three-judge federal appeals panel but were rebuffed. Judge Greer issued an injunction keeping the DCF and police away from Terri. Courts consistently rejected appeals related to abuse allegations or new medical diagnoses, and efforts to block Terri's cremation. The US Supreme Court again declined involvement. A federal appeals court agreed to consider a new hearing but Terri died first.    Terri Schiavo died on Thursday 31 March, thirteen days after her feeding tube was removed by court order. Her husband has requested an autopsy. In the final two weeks of Schiavo's life, at least 47 protestors were arrested and there were numerous appeals to have the tube reinserted. Efforts even included a congressional bill to shift jurisdiction from state to federal courts and President Bush's rush back from Texas to sign that bill. In Florida Governor Bush tried to get custody transferred to the Florida government. And the case bounced back and forth in state and federal courts. </text> <scu uid=\"38\" label=\"Terri Schiavo dies after tube removed\">  <contributor label=\"Terri Schiavo died 18 days after her

        "summary": "  The July 7 London bombing death toll is now 56, including four suicide bombers. Police identified the four and know details of their final movements. All were British of Pakistani origin. Police raided five premises in Leeds and recovered a car they expect will yield evidence. Authorities were tipped off when one bomber's mother called a help line to report him missing. ABC News reported that the alleged bomb maker behind the London attacks was arrested in Egypt. Authorities fear that a number of recent arson attacks on mosques in England may have been retaliation for the bombings.    The death toll rose to 56 and 44 victims of the bombings remain in hospitals, nine in intensive care. Four of those dead were suicide bombers who carried out the bombings. Police identified three of the bombers by name and said that all four were British of Pakistani origin. Police were able to trace the movements on CCTV of the bombers from their arrival at a carpark until just before the explosions. Armed with warrants, police raided five premises in Leeds; home to a large Muslim population of south Asian origin.    The four bombers were British of Pakistani origin and were among the 56 killed. The bombers left their homes in West Yorkshire and drove a rented a car to Luton, NW of London, where they met a fourth accomplice. Closed circuit television at King's Cross caught them all chatting, then they split up. The mother of one reported him missing after the blasts, leading to identifications and raids on five premises in Leeds, which has a large Moslem population. The alleged bomb-builder was arrested in Egypt. After the bombings, several arson attacks took place on mosques in northwest England.    As of 20 July, the death toll stood at 56, with all victims identified. Police had finished their investigations on site and moved one subway car from the underground tunnel to a police compound for further investigation.  The suspected bombers, all four of whom were killed in the explosions, were Islamic extremists. British of Pakistani origin, the four were captured on closed ciruit TV at King's Cross soon before the bomings. An additional suspect was said to have been arrested in Cairo, Egypt, on 15 July. </text> <scu uid=\"74\" label=\"4 bombers\">  <contributor label=\"four...bombers\">   <part label=\"four\" start=\"119\" end=\"123\"/>   <part label=\"bombers\" start=\"132\" end=\"139\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"Four...bombers who carried out the bombings\">   <part label=\"Four\" start=\"809\" end=\"813\"/>   <part label=\"bombers who carried out the bombings\" start=\"841\" end=\"877\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"The four bombers\">   <part label=\"The four bombers\" start=\"1285\" end=\"1301\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"The suspected bombers, all four\">   <part label=\"The suspected bombers, all four\" start=\"2156\" end=\"2187\"/>  </contributor> </scu> <scu uid=\"37\" label=\"4 bombers included in 56 dead\">  <contributor label=\"death toll is now 56, including four suicide bombers\">   <part label=\"death toll is now 56, including four suicide bombers\" start=\"87\" end=\"139\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"Four of those dead were suicide bombers\">   <part label=\"Four of those dead were suicide bombers\" start=\"809\" end=\"848\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"The four bombers...were among the 56 killed\">   <part label=\"The four bombers\" start=\"1285\" end=\"1301\"/>   <part label=\"were among the 56 killed\" start=\"1339\" end=\"1363\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"The suspected bombers, all four of whom were killed in the explosions\">   <part label=\"The suspected bombers, all four of whom were killed in the explosions\" start=\"2156\" end=\"2225\"/>  </contributor> </scu> <scu uid=\"44\" label=\"Authorities know details of bombers' final movements\">  <contributor label=\"Police...know details of their final movements\">   <part label=\"know details of their final movements\" start=\"172\" end=\"209\"/>   <part label=\"Police\" start=\"141\" end=\"147\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"the four were captured on closed ciruit TV at King's Cross soon before the bomings\">   <part label=\"the four were captured on closed ciruit TV at King's Cross soon before the bomings\" start=\"2281\" end=\"2363\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"Police were able to trace the movements on CCTV of the bombers from their arrival at a carpark until just before the explosions\">   <part label=\"Police were able to trace the movements on CCTV of the bombers from their arrival at a carpark until just before the explosions\" start=\"983\" end=\"1110\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"The bombers left their homes in West Yorkshire and drove a rented a car to Luton, NW of London, where they met a fourth accomplice.

        "summary": "  Congressional hearings and an undercover probe investigating illegal steroid use in Major League Baseball and other sports continues. Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig admitted the League's policy is not strong enough and has proposed much stricter penalties. They include a 50-game suspension for the first offense and a lifetime ban for the third one. These penalties would apply to minor-league players next year. Selig also requested amphetamines be added to the banned substances. Congress has threatened to implement a testing system unless the League strengthened its policy. The Players Association has not responded to the proposed penalties.    Under pressure from Congress, Major League Baseball's players association toughened drug testing rules and penalties again for the 2006 season. Suspensions will be increased to 50 games for a first offense, 100 for a second, and a lifetime ban for the third. Congress launched an undercover probe into illegal steroid use in Major League Baseball. News of the probe surprised MLB officials. Rafael Palmeiro was suspended 10 days for a positive steroid test. He denied intentionally taking the drug. Other players with 10-day steroid test suspensions were Felix Heredia and Carlos Almanzar. New doping allegations surfaced about Barry Bonds.    Congress has launched an undercover probe into illegal steroid use in major league baseball. To highlight the problem, baseball heavy hitters Mark McGuire, Raphael Palmeiro and Sammy Sosa testified before the responsible congressional committee. In a letter to the players' union, Selig proposes a 50-game suspension for first offenders instead of the current 10-game suspension. A second offense would result in a 100-day suspension and a third, a lifetime ban. The players' union has concerns since several steroid agents stay in the blood stream for a long period. A one-time user who swore off could show positive in future testing.     Congressional investigators chided Major League Baseball leaders for being uncooperative regarding steroid use and urged star players to take public responsibility for their actions. Congress also launched an undercover probe. Players proposed strengthening the collective bargaining steroid proposal. Bud Selig proposed a 50-game suspension for first offenders, 100-game suspension for second, and lifetime ban for third. 2003 tests showed 104 steroid users.

        "summary": "  Three weeks after Katrina pets are still being rescued. 5,000 plus have been rescued but thousands have perished. Emergency responders are voluntarily assisting but humane societies are requesting a policy that local, state and federal responders will diligently assist with pet rescues. Representatives Lantos and Oberstar are co-sponsoring the Pets Evacuation and Transportation Standards Act to force local and state governments to create emergency evacuation plans for pets or forfeit FEMA disaster grant eligibility. Rescued animals are being fostered in prisons and other states as local shelters are overwhelmed. Unprecedented millions of dollars are being donated for pet rescue effort.    Rescue efforts continue for pets abandoned in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. Some are still found alive, but estimated tens of thousands have already died. By 10 October, some 8,000 animals have been rescued. At least 600 have been reunited with their owners. Tens of millions of dollars have been donated for Katrina animal rescue. Animals have been sent from the Lamar-Dixon shelter and another at Louisiana State University to smaller shelters, foster homes and even prisons across the country to await reunions or adoption. Lamar-Dixon will be shut down on 15 October. Petfinder.com will list pets through 15 December.    Five thousand pets have been rescued but time is running out for the rest. Many animals are sick from consuming contaminated water, garbage and carrion. LSU's Parker Coliseum (Baton Rouge) houses over a thousand rescued pets and Lamar-Dixon expo center (Gonzales) holds up to 2,000, including larger and sicker animals. Staff are from the Humane Society, US Public Health Service, FEMA, and volunteers. Pets are sent to smaller shelters, foster homes, and prisons for longer-term care. Over 600 have been reunited with owners. Rescuing people takes priority but the Humane Society and a bill in Congress urge pet evacuation also.    Tens of millions of dollars have been donated to pet charities because of Hurricane Katrina, but weeks after the storm, abandoned animals are still a major concern. It is estimated that more than 50,000 pets were left behind. Hundreds arrive at shelters every day, most suffering from at least one ailment, such as dysentery, infection, malnutrition, dehydration. Many died before they could be rescued. Local shelters are overwhelmed, so some animals are being sent to shelters and foster homes in other states. Two prisons have taken in animals, which the inmates will care for until permanent homes can be found. </text> <scu uid=\"277\" label=\"Pets still being rescued\">  <contributor label=\"pets are still

        "summary": "  Scanlon pleaded guilty to conspiring to bribe a congressman and other public officials. His help was expected to be crucial in the Justice Department's wide-ranging Abramoff investigations. On Dec. 28, 2005 the Justice Department was urgently pressing Abramoff to settle fraud and bribery allegations as the investigation continued. A court date was set for Jan. 9, 2006 as Senate and criminal investigations continued. On Jan. 3 Abramoff pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate. He agreed to provide evidence and testimony in the Justice Department's probe of corruption in Congress and executive branch agencies.    Michael Scanlon pleaded guilty to conspiring to bribe public officials and agreed to pay back over $19 million to Indian tribal clients. His possible 5-year prison sentence could be reduced should he cooperate with prosecutors. Abramoff pleaded guilty to federal conspiracy, fraud and tax evasion charges and agreed to cooperate with investigators. He did not identify officials by name. The next day he pleaded guilty to fraud and conspiracy in Florida. Panicked lawmakers, including President Bush, rushed to distance themselves from Abramoff by returning campaign money he gave them. The money is being returned or redirected to charities.    Abramoff pleaded guilty to conspiracy, fraud and tax evasion and agreed to cooperate with federal officials investing political corruption. Abramoff is also facing trial on fraud charges in Florida connected with purchasing a casino cruise chip company. In his plea agreement, Abramoff committed to making 25 million in restitution to his victims and paying 1.2 million to the IRS for tax evasion. His prison sentence could be lowered depending on assistance he provides in the corruption investigation of as many as 20 members of Congress or top congressional aides.    Abramoff's extensive corruption schemes are the subject of a Senate probe and criminal investigations by the Department of Justice and Florida prosecutors. Investigators are looking at congressmen, aides, government officials, and lobbyists, including Rep. John Doolittle, Stephen Griles, and Tony Rudy, and will follow the case wherever it leads. Scanlon pled guilty to bribery and agreed to make restitution to tribes. His help would be crucial to the Abramoff investigation. Abramoff pled guilty to conspiracy, fraud, and tax evasion and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. Co-defendant Adam Kidan agreed to testify against Abramoff regarding fraud in a ship company purchase. </text> <scu uid=\"8\" label=\"Abramoff agreed to cooperate\">  <contributor

        "summary": "  Prior to parliamentary elections on Feb. 27, 2005 about 300 opposition activists gathered in Kyrgyzstan's capital Bishkek demonstrating in favor of democratic elections and calling for President Askar Akayev to step down at the end of his second term in October. The administration staged a counter-demonstration. After Akayev won overwhelming election victories the opposition charged the government with mass election violations, blocked roads, occupied government buildings, and held a regional governor and a district chief hostage. Akayev ordered investigation and negotiations and fired the interior minister and prosecutor general while police dispersed crowds in Bishkek.    In February 2005 rallies in Bishkek urged President Akayev to step down as promised and constitutionally required after October presidential elections, fearing a referendum to continue his reign. Akayev supporters won a landslide parliamentary victory. Opposition leaders and the European Organization for Security and Cooperation charged the elections were flawed. By March 16 opposition forces rallied, blocked roads, occupied government buildings, demanded Akayev's resignation, and took hostage a regional governor and district chief. On March 20 four policemen were beaten after police fired shots at demonstrators. Akayev ordered investigations into election fraud charges and fired the interior minister and prosecutor-general.    Kyrgyz oppositionists, fearing President Akayev might hold onto power longer than his constitutional two terms, rallied and urged him to step down. He refused, saying elections were fair, opposition leaders were unnecessarily inciting civil war, and talks were the solution to the crisis. The opposition refused to accept a landslide victory by Akayev supporters in parliamentary elections and claimed fraud. They blocked roads, occupied government buildings, and took a governor and district chief hostage. When police fired shots to dispel rioters, crowds beat four policemen to death. Akayev ordered fraud claims investigated and replaced the interior minister and prosecutor-general.    Parliamentary elections were held in Kyrgyzstan on 27 February, with presidential elections planned for October. Akayev supporters won a landslide victory in most areas, but both opposition leaders and western observers cited mass violations. Run-off parliamentary elections were held in many regions on 13 March. The opposition was defeated but refused to accept the results and demanded Akayev's resignation. Even before the election, opposition leaders had been calling for Akayev to step down as President at the end of October in accordance with the constitution. But Akayev refused to resign or to annul the election results. </text> <scu uid=\"64\" label=\"Akayev won a landslide parliamentary victory.\">  <contributor label=\"Akayev won overwhelming election

        "summary": "  The Lefkow murder investigation continues. FBI Director Mueller testified to lawmakers that the case will be solved. Bart Ross confessed to the Lefkow murders in his suicide note. Several years ago Judge Lefkow had dismissed Ross' billion dollar medical malpractice suit. DNA evidence gathered at the murder scene matched Ross' DNA. Gun shells found at the suicide location along with the note recounting details only the killer would know point to Ross as the likely killer. No evidence has been found linking Ross to the Hale supremacist group. Authorities will not close the case before ballistic results are completed.    The Lefkow murder investigation took a surprising turn when Bart Ross committed suicide at a traffic stop on March 9, leaving a handwritten confession in his car. Later that day, a local TV station receive a typed suicide letter, dated February 13, which included a hit list of judges, lawyers and doctors and a handwritten account of the Lefkow killings. Ross felt he was a medical malpractice victim and spent over a decade unsuccessfully pursuing lawsuits. Judge Lefkow, who recently ruled against Ross, was his primary target the day of the killings. DNA evidence confirm he was the killer.    Bart Ross, 57, was pulled over by police in a Milwaukee suburb for a defective taillight. Ross immediately committed suicide with a shot to his head. In his van was a letter describing how after treatment for mouth cancer left him disfigured, Judge Lefkow and others ruined his life by dismissing his medical malpractice suit. He vowed to kill them. On February 28th he hid in a Lefkow closet waiting for the judge, but her family found him first so he killed them instead. DNA from a cigarette butt in the home matched Ross's and he resembled a composite sketch.    The killer of Judge Lefkow's husband and mother, Bart Ross, killed himself on 9 March with a single shot to the head when he was stopped for a routine traffic violation. In his van was a suicide note linking him to the murders. He had pursued a decade-long malpractice suit over severe disfigurement resulting from treatment for a cancerous jaw, a suit Lefkow had dismissed a number of years ago. He wrote that she was &quot;No. 1 to kill&quot; because she had &quot;finished me off.&quot; He had a hit list of 25 other judges, lawyers, and doctors. </text> <scu uid=\"5\" label=\"Bart Ross

        "summary": "  After 18 months the International Astronomical Union has still not determined the criteria for planethood. Pluto's eventual status will also define new space objects. However the data from the Pluto space probe in 2015 will come too late to settle this argument. Recent discovery of two additional moons around Pluto complicate the issue. The diameter of Pluto and UB313 is about 1,380 and 1,800 miles respectively and both have methane ice on their surfaces. Proposed definitions based on size or gravitational pull either include or exclude Pluto and UB313. The scientific deadlock at the Union will not be resolved quickly.    A committee of the International Astronomical Union (IAU) is considering the question of planethood of Pluto and 2003 UB313 (Xena). Both might be called &quot;minor planets&quot; or could be considered KBOs. NASA's Hubble Space telescope strengthened Pluto's claim to planethood by finding its second and perhaps third moon. On Jan 20, 2006 NASA launched its New Horizon spacecraft to explore Pluto and the Kuiper Belt which it is scheduled to reach in July 2015. Meanwhile German astronomers determined that the diameter of 2003 UB313 is 1800 miles compared to Pluto's 1380. The IAU committee continues to deliberate.    Debate continues over what constitutes a planet. Some astronomers say a planet should have a diameter greater than 2,000 kilometers (both Pluto and UB313 do). Another suggestion is roundness: this would include these two and likely several others yet unknown. Another possible definition is that a planet must gravitationally dominate its surroundings, which would exclude Pluto and UB313. Pluto became more interesting when the Hubble telescope discoverd that Pluto had not just one but three moons. Scientific interest in Pluto and Kuiper Belt objects led to the New Horizons spacecraft mission: a nine year trip to Pluto and beyond.     Scientists debate redefining &quot;planet&quot; or retiring the term. KBO 2003 UB313, discovered by Michael E. Brown, was confirmed by surface heat emanations to be 30 percent larger than Pluto. Both have surface methane ice. If Pluto is a planet, 2003 UB313 should be too. The Hubble Space Telescope showed two more small moons orbiting Pluto, 30-100 miles in diameter. Pluto and its large moon Charon, close physically and in size, may be a binary planet system orbiting a center mass between them. At least four KBOs have known moons. Pluto would be the first KBO to have multiple satellites.  </text> <scu uid=\"1\" label=\"The International Astronomical Union has not defined &quot;planet&quot;.\">  <contributor label=\"After 18 months the International Astronomical Union has still not determined the criteria for planethood\">   <part label=\"After 18 months the International Astronomical Union has still not determined the criteria for planethood\" start=\"61\" end=\"166\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"A committee of the International Astronomical Union (IAU) is considering the question of planethood\">   <part label=\"A committee of the International Astronomical Union (IAU) is considering the question of planethood\" start=\"745\" end=\"844\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"Debate continues over what constitutes a planet\">   <part label=\"Debate continues over what constitutes a planet\" start=\"1411\" end=\"1458\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"Scientists debate redefining &quot;planet&quot; or retiring the term\">   <part label=\"Scientists debate redefining &quot;planet&quot; or retiring the term\" start=\"2105\" end=\"2163\"/>  </contributor> </scu> <scu uid=\"2\" label=\"Pluto's eventual status will also define 2003 UB313's.\">  <contributor label=\"Pluto's eventual status will also define new space objects\">   <part label=\"Pluto's eventual status will also define new space objects\" start=\"168\" end=\"226\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"Pluto and 2003 UB313 (Xena).

        "summary": "  In July 2005 ornithologists Richard Prum, Mark Robbins and Jerome Jackson, submitted a paper questioning the sufficiency of the evidence for the ivory-billed woodpecker's rediscovery. They withdrew their paper after hearing audio recordings of calls and raps reportedly matching 1930's recordings of the bird. But they and others remained skeptical. In December over 100 researchers and volunteers began an intensive six-month search across 500,000 acres of Arkansas wetlands seeking definitive evidence of the bird. A local town benefited from bird watching tourists. In January 2006 Jackson published an article saying claims for proof of the bird's existence constitute &quot;faith-based ornithology&quot;.    Biologists question evidence in sightings of rare ivory-billed woodpecker. The issue is whether four seconds of fuzzy videotape is an ivory-billed or pileated woodpecker. Recordings of the ivory-billed woodpecker's distinctive double-rap sounds convinced scientists of this bird's existence. A crew from Cornell Lab and its partner agencies will train 100 volunteers for a six-month search of 500,000 acres in the eastern Arkansas wetlands. An ivory-bill specialist criticized the finding saying the bird's existence hasn't been confirmed and the videotape shows a pileated woodpecker.    Three biologists questioned reported sightings and a fuzzy videotape as sufficient evidence that the ivory-billed woodpecker is not extinct. However, more recent audio recordings of calls and distinctive double-rap sounds removed their doubts. Cornell ornithologists made 17,000 hours of recordings near the Cache and White rivers in Arkansas. The discovery raised concerns that this habitat could be inundated with bird watchers. Cornell will train 100 volunteers for a six-month search for the bird. Federal authorities have provided $10.2M toward the effort and the Nature Conservancy has bought 18,000 acres of Big Woods habitat to set aside for the bird.    The rediscovery of the ivory-billed woodpecker was challenged in late April, almost three months after its announcement. Three biologists planned to publish a paper saying that the evidence was insufficient, a conclusion also reached by Sibley, author of well-known field guides. But two of the scientists were given recordings based on 18,000 hours of audio and, on the basis of this &quot;new evidence,&quot; they withdrew their challenge and the paper was not published. In January 2006, however, the third biologist voiced the strongest criticism to date, saying that he was still not convinced. The search continues. </text> <scu uid=\"1\" label=\"In July 2005 three biologists submitted a paper questioning the evidence for the rediscovery of the ivory-billed woodpecker.\">  <contributor label=\"Biologists question evidence in sightings of rare ivory-billed woodpecker\">   <part label=\"Biologists question evidence in sightings of rare ivory-billed woodpecker\" start=\"818\" end=\"891\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"Three biologists questioned...evidence that the ivory-billed woodpecker is not extinct\">   <part label=\"Three biologists questioned\" start=\"1461\" end=\"1488\"/>   <part label=\"evidence that the ivory-billed woodpecker is not extinct\" start=\"1544\" end=\"1600\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"Three biologists planned to publish a paper saying that the evidence was insufficient\">   <part label=\"Three biologists planned to publish a paper saying that the evidence was insufficient\" start=\"2299\" end=\"2384\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"In July 2005 ornithologists Richard Prum, Mark Robbins and Jerome Jackson, submitted a paper questioning the sufficiency of the evidence for the ivory-billed woodpecker's rediscovery\">   <part label=\"In July 2005 ornithologists Richard Prum, Mark Robbins and Jerome Jackson, submitted a paper questioning the sufficiency of the evidence for the ivory-billed woodpecker's rediscovery\" start=\"61\" end=\"243\"/>  </contributor> </scu> <scu uid=\"19\" label=\"Recordings of the ivory-billed woodpecker's distinctive double-rap sounds convinced scientists of the bird's existence\">  <contributor label=\"Recordings of the ivory-billed woodpecker's distinctive double-rap sounds convinced scientists of this bird's existence\">   <part label=\"Recordings of the ivory-billed woodpecker's distinctive double-rap sounds convinced scientists of this bird's existence\" start=\"989\" end=\"1108\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"They withdrew their paper after hearing audio recordings of calls and raps reportedly matching 1930's recordings of the bird\">   <part label=\"They withdrew their paper after hearing audio recordings of calls and raps reportedly matching 1930's recordings of the bird\" start=\"245\" end=\"369\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"two of the scientists were given recordings based on 18,000 hours of audio and, on the basis of this &quot;new evidence,&quot; they withdrew their challenge\">   <part label=\"two of the scientists were given recordings based on 18,000 hours of audio and, on the basis of this &quot;new evidence,&quot; they withdrew their challenge\" start=\"2462\" end=\"2608\"/>  </contributor> </scu> <scu uid=\"18\" label=\"Some questioned whether the video was of an ivory-billed woodpecker.\">  <contributor label=\"Biologists question...whether four seconds of fuzzy videotape is an ivory-billed or pileated woodpecker...An ivory-bill specialist criticized the finding saying the bird's existence hasn't been confirmed and the videotape shows a pileated woodpecker\">   <part label=\"Biologists question\" start=\"818\" end=\"837\"/>   <part label=\"whether four seconds of fuzzy videotape is an ivory-billed or pileated woodpecker\" start=\"906\" end=\"987\"/>   <part label=\"An ivory-bill specialist criticized the finding saying the bird's existence hasn't been confirmed and the videotape shows a pileated woodpecker\" start=\"1259\" end=\"1402\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"Three biologists questioned reported sightings and a fuzzy videotape as sufficient evidence that the ivory-billed woodpecker is not extinct\">   <part label=\"Three biologists questioned reported sightings and a fuzzy videotape as sufficient evidence that the ivory-billed woodpecker is not extinct\" start=\"1461\" end=\"1600\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"But they and others remained skeptical\">   <part label=\"But they and others remained skeptical\" start=\"371\" end=\"409\"/>  </contributor> </scu> <scu uid=\"7\" label=\"The paper was withdrawn after the authors heard audio recordings of calls and raps\">  <contributor label=\"They withdrew their paper after hearing audio recordings of calls and raps\">   <part label=\"They withdrew their paper after hearing audio recordings of calls and raps\" start=\"245\" end=\"319\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"more recent audio recordings of calls and distinctive double-rap sounds removed their doubts\">   <part label=\"more recent audio recordings of calls and distinctive double-rap sounds removed their doubts\" start=\"1611\" end=\"1703\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"two of the scientists were given recordings based on 18,000 hours of audio and, on the basis of this &quot;new evidence,&quot; they withdrew their challenge and the paper was not published.

        "summary": "  Christine A. Gregoire was sworn in as the new governor on Jan. 12, 2005. In the first action on Dino Rossi's lawsuit to oust Gregoire the Judge declared that his courtroom and not the Democratic-controlled legislature was the proper forum to investigate the election. The case was scheduled to go to trial May 23. Although Democrats acknowledged human errors in vote counting, they vigorously denied Republican charges of fraud. The lawsuit was dismissed on June 6 for lack of evidence and Rossi did not appeal to the Supreme Court.    Christine Gregoire's inauguration as Washington's governor occurred amid a legal challenge by Republican candidate Rossi. Chelan County Superior Court Judge John Bridges ruled that his court rather than the state legislature would investigate the election. The judge ruled that before ordering a new election or declaring Rossi the winner, Republicans would need to prove Rossi received more votes than Gregoire after supposed illegal votes were deducted. Bridges noted that the only proven illegal votes had been for Rossi. Five months after the inauguration, Judge Bridges dismissed the Republican lawsuit. After that ruling, Rossi ended his legal effort to remove Gregoire.    Gregoire was sworn in as governor and proceeded to govern as if elected by landslide, imposing taxes and improving roads. Rossi sued for a revote in Republican-leaning, rural Chelan County, claiming illegal votes by felons and ballot-box stuffing. Most Washingtonians opposed a revote. Constitutional language on contested races was ambiguous. Judge John E. Bridges heard the case without a jury. He dismissed the lawsuit because Rossi's lawyers failed to meet their burden of proof. Most of the proved illegal votes by felons were for Rossi. Rossi ended his efforts to remove Gregoire, who was certified as governor-elect in June 2005.    Democrat Christine Gregoire was sworn in as governor of Washington state on 12 January after an extremely close election. The Republicans sued to overturn the gubernatorial election, charging election fraud. A judge dismissed the lawsuit on 6 June, asserting that there were human errors but no fraud, and Republican Dino Rossi decided to end his 5-month legal fight. Gregoire was declared the winner in late June by the Washington Secretary of State. Meanwhile, by the end of the month Rossi vowed to continue his fight and called for a new vote. </text> <scu uid=\"55\" label=\"Gregoire sworn in as governor\">  <contributor label=\"Christine A.

        "summary": "  Relief for the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims continues. More than $10 billion has been pledged by 42 countries and individuals. Debt relief and loans are also being offered. Concerts, telethons, and charity auctions are among the methods being used to solicit donations. President Bush made a personal contribution of $10,000. Bush recruited Former Presidents Clinton and Bush, his father, to lead fundraising efforts in the U.S. President Bush signed a law permitting U.S. taxpayers to deduct contributions to tsunami relief in January 2005 from their 2004 returns. The Canadian government will match all private donations to approved aid agencies.    Financial contributions for Asian Tsunami relief had exceeded $10 billion by Jan. 12, 2005. Governmental contributions passed $8 billion while private gifts exceeded $2 billion. The United Nations announced that it has secured aid commitments worth $717 million. Governmental contributions were led by Japan with $74m. and Germany at $68m. The outstanding organizational contributor was World Vision Australia which had raised $15.3m through a telethon. Individual contributors were led by a Canadian couple Kroum and Eva Pindoff who gave $4.1m through the Canadian Red Cross which will be matched by the Canadian government to total $8.2m.    Governments have pledged over eight billion dollars in aid for countries hit by the Asian tsunami and private contributions have added over two billion dollars. Countries pledging aid include: Japan, Britain, Germany, Norway, European Commission, the US, Canada, Sweden, Denmark, Russia, China, Australia and Finland. Money raised from ticket sales for a Canadian TV broadcast will go to tsunami relief. An Australian telethon and Melbourne cricket match raised money for relief. Two Chinese banks have made large contributions. Individuals making large contributions include actress Sandra Bullock, President George Bush, a Chinese couple and Kroum and Eva Pindoff, a Canadian couple.    As of 12 January, donations and pledges continued to pour in for tsunami relief. Government donations from 42 countries exceeded $8 billion. Australia had raised more per capita than any other country, including donations made through a telethon and a pop concert telecast simultaneously on all three TV networks. The UN had aid commitments for $717 million for emergency relief, with Japan as the major contributor at $250 million. Private donations reached more than $2 billion, the largest from a Canadian couple, who gave $4.1 million, which the Canadian government will match. </text> <scu uid=\"2\" label=\"Government donations

        "summary": "  23 countries recently met in Greenland to encourage governments to act on global warming instead of arguing. Worldwide, countries are agreeing that the U.N. Kyoto Protocol, which commits 39 nations to reduce greenhouse gases, is not enough. Infrastructure in Russia is being damaged due to the melting permafrost including airports, gas pipelines and railways. Wildlife including polar bears, reindeer, seals, and fish are threatened as well as many plant species. Fishing zones are disappearing. Shipping lanes are at risk. The Arctic and Antarctic of today will be radically changed within the next century if action is not taken worldwide.    Arctic sea ice is melting faster. Its area is down 20% and it all could disappear this century. Thinning sea ice threatens extinction of polar bears. Less ice reflects less sunlight, warming the planet, leading to more ice melt and sea-level rise. Greenland and Antarctic ice shelf melting will double the estimated global sea level rise to 1 meter. Arctic permafrost thaw releases warming greenhouse gases, which will increase permafrost melting up to 11 feet deep by 2100. Greenland's ice fishing season has shortened. Lake areas doubled. Glaciers Sermeg, Sermilik, and Kangerdlugssuag melted faster. Alaska's Columbia glacier also melted faster.    Climate change could thaw the top 11 feet of permafrost in most areas of the Northern Hemisphere by 2100 altering ecosystems across Alaska, Canada and Russia according to a US study. If this occurs, considerable amounts of greenhouse gases could be released into the atmosphere, which could amplify global warming. However, another researcher disagrees that the thaw would be so large. He states that Alaska's permafrost won't melt that fast or deep. A group of countries, which fringe the Artic waters, met to discuss measures to reduce greenhouse emissions.     Several international meetings have been held to address the issues of global warming and climate change. There continues to be disagreement on whether or not this is the effect of human activity, although scientists agree that something has changed radically and that there are few other explanations. New satellite photos show that Arctic ice is melting faster than before and that air temperatures are rising sharply. And two explorers working with Greenpeace could not complete a trip from Siberia to the North Pole because of the effects of rising temperatures, including broken ice, strong currents, and heavy rainfall. </text> <scu uid=\"69\" label=\"23 countries met\">  <contributor label=\"23 countries...recently...met\">   <part label=\"23 countries\" start=\"61\" end=\"73\"/>   <part label=\"met\" start=\"83\" end=\"86\"/>   <part label=\"recently\" start=\"74\" end=\"82\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"A group of countries, which fringe the Artic waters, met to discuss measures to reduce greenhouse emissions\">   <part label=\"A group of countries, which fringe the Artic waters, met to discuss measures to reduce greenhouse emissions\" start=\"1918\" end=\"2025\"/>  </contributor> </scu> <scu uid=\"70\" label=\"23 countries met in Greenland\">  <contributor label=\"23 countries...met...in Greenland\">   <part label=\"23 countries\" start=\"61\" end=\"73\"/>   <part label=\"met\" start=\"83\" end=\"86\"/>   <part label=\"in Greenland\" start=\"87\" end=\"99\"/>  </contributor> </scu> <scu uid=\"71\" label=\"23 countries met to encourage governments to act on global warming\">  <contributor label=\"23 countries...met...to encourage governments...to act on global warming...instead of arguing\">   <part label=\"23 countries\" start=\"61\" end=\"73\"/>   <part label=\"met\" start=\"83\" end=\"86\"/>   <part label=\"to encourage governments\" start=\"100\" end=\"124\"/>   <part label=\"instead of arguing\" start=\"150\" end=\"168\"/>   <part label=\"to act on global warming\" start=\"125\" end=\"149\"/>  </contributor> </scu> <scu uid=\"78\" label=\"countries agree Kyoto Protocol not enough\">  <contributor label=\"Worldwide...countries are agreeing...U.N.

        "summary": "  Syria's withdrawal of forces from Lebanon, required by UN Resolution 1559, Sept. 2, 2004, was not satisfied by Syria's proposal on Feb. 24, 2005 to pull back into eastern Lebanon. The U.N. Chief, supported by Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the U.S., France and Russia, called for full withdrawal. On March 5 the Syrian President promised pullback to the border. A top UN envoy on March 12 demanded a full withdrawal by April 30, a position supported by the European Union. By April 26 withdrawal was under way and the UN had sent a team to verify whether it was complete.    UN Security Council Resolution 1559 mandated withdrawal of &quot;foreign forces&quot; (Syria's troops and intelligence agents) from Lebanon. After the February 14, 2005 assassination of former Lebanon Prime Minister Hariri, Anon told Syria to withdraw before April, threatening sanctions. Egypt and Saudi Arabia asked Syria to withdraw by April 30, under the 1989 Taif Accord. Lebanon's pro-Syria government resigned March 1. On March 12 Anon sent envoy Roed-Larsen to Syria with an ultimatum. Syria pledged to withdraw all troops. EU Foreign Ministers asked Syria to rapidly implement its pledge.     The February assassination of former Lebanon Prime Minister Hariri put Syria under renewed pressure from the international community to abide by U.N. Security Council Resolution 1559 and withdraw its troops from Lebanon. The US, France and other European Union nations urged Syria to comply. Egypt and Saudi Arabia encouraged Syria to withdraw its troops by the U.N. deadline of April 30. Faced with a U.N. ultimatum, on April 3 Syria pledged to remove all troops and intelligence agents by April 30. The U.N. sent a team of inspectors to verify whether the withdrawal was complete at the end of April.    The killing of Lebanon's former PM Rafiq Hariri renewed calls for Syria to abide by UN Security Council Resolution 1559 and end its domination of Lebanon. Nine council members voted for the resolution, six abstained. Egypt and Saudi Arabia are trying to persuade Syria to accept a timetable for withdrawal of its troops. The US and France have been leading calls for Syria's withdrawal. The European Union called for a precise timetable for withdrawal. UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan said that withdrawal must be handled with care. Under mounting pressure, Syria has withdrawn 4,000 of its 14,000 troops. </text> <scu uid=\"49\" label=\"Demands for Syria's full withdrawal from Lebanon\">  <contributor label=\"The U.N.

        "summary": "  On the night of Nov. 9, 2005 the level of violence throughout France showed the first signs of abating. More than 11,500 police and gendarmes in 300 cities and towns had been mobilized. Residents, police and firefighters suffered one death and more than 115 injuries. More than 7500 vehicles were torched. Although the riots were ignited by the accidental electrocution death of two teenagers, President Chirac acknowledged that France must confront inequalities and discrimination among its African and Muslim minorities that fueled the unrest. On Nov. 14 emergency powers were extended for three months.    After long police absence, Sarkozy's October 19 declaration of &quot;war without mercy&quot; on violent suburbs fueled the riots starting October 27. On November 8, France declared a state of emergency, and offered social assistance. By November 11, 118 residents, police, firefighters, and foreign journalists were injured, with $US 235 million total damage. By November 13, torched vehicles exceeded 8,000 and arrests exceeded 2,200. Vehicle torchings and arrests, respectively, November 1 - 12 were: 180/34, ?/?, 517/78, 897/250, 1300/349, 1408/395, 1173/330, 617/?, 482/?, 325/?, 384/162, 315/161. (Before the riots, 3,500 vehicles burned monthly nationwide.) France extended emergency powers on November 14.    With a state of emergency declaration, overnight curfews, and a public meetings ban, violent riots around Paris and throughout France steadily abated. The situation markedly improved by the 18th night. The French cabinet extended emergency police powers for three months to ensure an end to the riots. Some 300 towns and cities were affected and around 11,500 anti-riot forces were mobilized. Damages and casualties were considerable. Over 115 citizens, police officers and firefighters were injured, as were three foreign reporters. A rioter lost a hand throwing a Molotov cocktail. Over 7,500 vehicles were torched and dozens of buildings destroyed.    Rioting and unrest spread to some 300 areas across France. The government declared a state of emergency but left it to local authorities to enact curfews or other measures. Many areas did impose curfews but Paris only banned public meetings. Police were mobilized and made hundreds of arrests. Most rioters are young Arab and black residents who complain of economic misery and discrimination. They burned hundreds of vehicles and other acts of arson. President Chirac acknowledged that France must confront the inequalities and discrimination that fueled the unrest. For years, police had warned that immigrant-dominated slums were about to explode.  </text> <scu uid=\"40\" label=\"Vehicles torched\">  <contributor label=\"They burned hundreds of vehicles\">

        "summary": "  Defendants argued intelligent design is science, not religion, because its testable &quot;irreducible complexity&quot; claim implies an intelligent designer but not necessarily God. One board member lied to hide that a church bought the &quot;Pandas&quot; books. On December 20, 2005 the judge ruled that the board's action violates the constitution. &quot;Intelligent design is &quot;a religious view, a mere re-labeling of creationism&quot;. He excoriated board members for lying in their testimony, for not bothering to understand intelligent design and for the &quot;breathtaking inanity of the Board's decision&quot;. The ruling is binding only in one Pennsylvania district. Dover will pay large legal fees.    For three weeks plaintiffs in the Kitzmiller vs. Dover Area School District trial presented expert witnesses who testified that intelligent design does not meet the definition of science because it cannot be proved or disproved. For the next three weeks, the defense called witnesses who testified that intelligent design is not based on religious beliefs, but on observable, physical evidence from nature. The judge ruled that compelling teachers to present intelligent design as an alternative explanation to evolution violates the Constitution. Dover residents ousted all eight school board members running for re-election who put their town in the global spotlight.    At the trial, a biochemistry professor at Lehigh and lawyers at the Thomas More Law Center testified for teaching intelligent design as a credible scientific theory. Scientists testifying for the parents dismissed intelligent design because it can't be tested by experiment. A federal judge ruled that teaching intelligent design as an alternative explanation to evolution violates the constitution. He wrote that the overwhelming evidence established that intelligent design is a religious view and not a scientific theory and its inclusion in public schools violates the separation of church and state.    Both sides agreed to a bench trial without a jury, common in First Amendment cases where arguments are about legal rather than factual issues. At the trial, board members said they wanted to &quot;encourage critical thinking.&quot; However, the parents presented evidence the board's purpose was religious and the intelligent design statement was a compromise after they could not teach creationism. The trial judge ruled that compelling biology teachers to present intelligent design as an alternative explanation to evolution violates the constitution. Four days after final arguments in the case, Dover residents ousted all eight school board members running for re-election. </text> <scu uid=\"6\" label=\"Trial was named Kitzmiller vs. Dover Area

        "summary": "  Airbus announced it is two to six months behind its promised A380 delivery schedule. Airlines are seeking millions in damages contractually agreed upon for delays. Airbus raised the price to approximately $292 million. A wing failure during testing may delay the A380's safety certification. The U.S. is investigating whether the jet will need special safety regulations due to the turbulence it generates. 33 were injured in an emergency evacuation drill. 873 passengers and crew exited under 80 seconds and the A380 passed the test. Airbus plans to deliver the first two jets to Singapore Airlines by the end of 2006.    By June 1, 2005 customizing A380s for 15 different client requirements, notably for different passenger entertainment systems, had delayed deliveries up to 8 months, risking millions in penalties. The first A380 delivery (to Singapore) slid from early to late 2006. With 159 orders from 16 customers and 100 options, production fell behind demand, raising the price to U.S. $292 million. Possible A380 air turbulence problems potentially requiring ICAO rule-making, a wing load test failure and passenger injuries during a simulated evacuation did not slow deliveries. By 2006 20 airports will be A380-ready; 38 by 2008; 60 by 2010.    The A380 has passed its emergency evacuation test, an important component toward the super jumbo's official certification for commercial flights. Airbus executives say the company will have to pay millions in compensation for late deliveries of the A380. Production problems rather than safety or quality issues have caused the delays. Airbus has 159 firm orders and 10 options from 16 clients. The US is studying the potential for turbulence generated by the A380 reflecting safety precautions.      In 2005 the A380 was six months behind schedule and owed millions in buyer compensation. Customized cabins and entertainment system installation problems caused delays. France called unreasonable a US-proposed safety review to determine whether A380 turbulence would require greater distances around the plane. Airbus raised the A380's price by $10 million. A wing ruptured during a February 2006 stress test but the plane qualified in emergency evacuation, an important step towards certification. Airbus was approaching its break-even point of 250 plane sales. Twenty airports would be ready for A380s in 2006, with Singapore Airlines being first to fly the plane.  </text> <scu uid=\"1\" label=\"A380 behind delivery schedule\">  <contributor label=\"Airbus announced it is two to six months behind its promised A380 delivery schedule\">   <part label=\"Airbus announced it is two to six months behind its promised A380 delivery schedule\" start=\"61\" end=\"144\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"delayed deliveries up to 8 months\">   <part label=\"delayed deliveries up to 8 months\" start=\"869\" end=\"902\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"In 2005 the A380 was six months behind schedule\">   <part label=\"In 2005 the A380 was six months behind schedule\" start=\"1983\" end=\"2030\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"late deliveries of the A380\">   <part label=\"late deliveries of the A380\" start=\"1654\" end=\"1681\"/>  </contributor> </scu> <scu uid=\"2\" label=\"Airbus to pay millions in penalties\">  <contributor label=\"Airlines are seeking millions in damages contractually agreed upon for delays\">   <part label=\"Airlines are seeking millions in damages contractually agreed upon for delays\" start=\"146\" end=\"223\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"risking millions in penalties\">   <part label=\"risking millions in penalties\" start=\"904\" end=\"933\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"Airbus executives say the company will have to pay millions in compensation\">   <part label=\"Airbus executives say the company will have to pay millions in compensation\" start=\"1574\" end=\"1649\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"owed millions in buyer compensation\">   <part label=\"owed millions in buyer compensation\" start=\"2035\" end=\"2070\"/>  </contributor> </scu> <scu uid=\"3\" label=\"Airbus raises price\">  <contributor label=\"Airbus raised the price to approximately $292 million\">   <part label=\"Airbus raised the price to approximately $292 million\" start=\"225\" end=\"278\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"raising the price to U.S. $292 million\">   <part label=\"raising the price to U.S. $292 million\" start=\"1086\" end=\"1124\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"Airbus raised the A380's price by $10 million\">   <part label=\"Airbus raised the A380's price by $10 million\" start=\"2294\" end=\"2339\"/>  </contributor> </scu> <scu uid=\"4\" label=\"Customization of A380 causes delays\">  <contributor label=\"Production problems rather than safety or quality issues have caused the delays\">   <part label=\"Production problems rather than safety or quality issues have caused the delays\" start=\"1683\" end=\"1762\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"Customized cabins and entertainment system installation problems caused delays\">   <part label=\"Customized cabins and entertainment system installation problems caused delays\" start=\"2072\" end=\"2150\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"By June 1, 2005...customizing A380s for 15 different client requirements...passenger entertainment systems...had delayed deliveries\">   <part label=\"customizing A380s for 15 different client requirements\" start=\"754\" end=\"808\"/>   <part label=\"passenger entertainment systems\" start=\"832\" end=\"863\"/>   <part label=\"By June 1, 2005\" start=\"738\" end=\"753\"/>   <part label=\"had delayed deliveries\" start=\"865\" end=\"887\"/>  </contributor> </scu> <scu uid=\"5\" label=\"A380 passed emergency evacuation test\">  <contributor label=\"A380 passed the test\">   <part label=\"A380 passed the test\" start=\"574\" end=\"594\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"the plane qualified in emergency evacuation, an important step towards certification\">   <part label=\"the plane qualified in emergency evacuation, an important step towards certification\" start=\"2396\" end=\"2480\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"A380 has passed its emergency evacuation test...important component...official certification for commercial flights\">   <part label=\"A380 has passed its emergency evacuation test\" start=\"1432\" end=\"1477\"/>   <part label=\"important component\" start=\"1482\" end=\"1501\"/>   <part label=\"official certification for commercial flights\" start=\"1527\" end=\"1572\"/>  </contributor> </scu> <scu uid=\"6\" label=\"Airports ready by 2006 for Airbus A380\">  <contributor label=\"By 2006 20 airports will be A380-ready;

        "summary": "  Sudan and Darfur's two main rebel groups, the Sudan Liberation Army and the Justice and Equality Movement, signed a ceasefire in Ndjamena in April, 2004. On October 6, the UK prime minister visited Sudan to discuss Darfur. AU-lead peace talks in Abuja between those Darfur rebels and Sudan ran August 23 through September 17, reconvened October 21, but were suspended by the AU on October 27. Libya hosted a &quot;mini-summit&quot; with leaders of Sudan, Egypt, Nigeria, Chad and the JEM in Tripoli on October 17-21; SLA declined. EU and AU officials met October 23-24 in Khartoum with the Sudan President.     Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, called for a Darfur mini-summit to be held on October 21, 2004 in Sirte, Libyan. Gadhafi invited the presidents of Sudan, Egypt, Chad, Nigeria and the leaders of Darfur's two rebel groups. Talks between Darfur rebels and the Sudanese government were held in Abuja, Nigeria in August and September 2004. The next round of talks will be held as part of the Darfur mini-summit, which was switched to Tripoli. This was done to obtain cooperation from neighboring countries, which is crucial to lasting peace.    Libya and the African Union have invited Sudanese President Omar al-Beshir to attend a mini-summit in Libya on October 21st with Chad, Egypt and Nigeria. Originally set for Sirte, Libya, the meeting was later shifted to Tripoli. Earlier talks had been held in Abuja in August and September. The Sudanese Liberation Army would not attend the Libyan meeting. British PM Tony Blair planned to meet in Addis Abbaba, Ethiopia with Nigerian President and current AU chairman Olusegun Obasanjo. Peace talks between the Sudanese government and rebel groups in Abuja, Nigeria, adjourned but would resume after Ramadan.    The latest Darfur peace talks opened on 24 October in Abuja, Nigeria. Sponsored by the African Union, the meetings between Khartoum and the Darfur rebels were expected to last at least three weeks. The meetings were adjourned on Wednesday morning so that AU mediators could prepare a document for discussion that same afternoon. An earlier AU summit in Abuja concerning the Darfur crisis collapsed on 18 September when the two sides disagreed on security issues. Foreign ministers from Libya, Sudan, Egypt, Nigeria, and Chad had met in Libya on 16 October to prepare for that summit. </text> <scu uid=\"68\" label=\"Ceasefire was signed by Sudan Liberation Army

        "summary": "  Debates continue in an effort to reach a compromise on Senate procedures for judicial nominees. Democrats feel the re-nomination of judges found unacceptable to them unprecedented. Both parties are using Brown's race, African American, in support of their opposite positions on her. Black members of Congress oppose Brown's confirmation. A compromise agreement was reached. Democrats will oppose any filibuster attempts regarding Brown's confirmation but the filibuster rules will remain unchanged. The successful cloture vote to end debate on Brown will now permit an up-or-down confirmation vote. After a 2 year delay Justice Brown was confirmed by a 56-43 vote.    As the Senate debated the issue of filibustering judicial nominations, a bipartisan group of centrist senators kept working on possible compromise solutions. On May 23, 14 moderate senators announced an agreement under which Democrats would vote to end debate on three nominations including Brown's, while Republicans agreed to oppose any attempt to change filibuster rules. On June 6 debate on  Brown's nomination opened with Republicans praising her great talent while Democrats deemed her an extreme conservative ideologue. On June 8, 10 Democrats joined Republicans to close debate and the Senate voted 56-43 to confirm Brown.    Just prior to the successful May 24, 2005 cloture vote for the first judicial nominee under Senate consideration (Pricilla Owen for U.S. Appeals Court 5th Circuit) 14 moderate Senators confirmed their mutual pact to: vote for cloture in judicial confirmations, except in &quot;extraordinary circumstances&quot;; not change filibuster rules; and vote for cloture for three less contentious federal judicial nominees, including Brown and Owen. On June 6, the Senate opened debate on Brown's confirmation. On June 7, 10 Democrats joined in the successful vote for cloture for Brown. On June 8, the Senate approved Brown's judicial appointment by 56-43.    Averting a showdown, Senate Democrats and Republicans finally reached a compromise which cleared the way for confirmation votes on California Supreme Court Justice Janice Rogers Brown's nomination to the US District Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. After stalling Brown's nomination with a 2-year filibuster threat, Democrats agreed to vote for cloture, ending the debate on June 7. Republicans agreed not to force a change in the application of Senate filibuster rules by the so-called nuclear option. On June 8, Janice Rogers Brown won confirmation. </text> <scu uid=\"1\" label=\"Senate debated the issue of filibustering judicial nominations\">  <contributor label=\"the Senate debated the issue of

        "summary": "  During his first 15 months as a U.S. Senator (Jan 2005-Mar 2006), Obama became better known and more widely admired. His book &quot;Dreams From My Father&quot; became a bestseller. On the senate floor he demonstrated willingness to work on a bipartisan basis on foreign and domestic issues. In party affairs he continued his successes as a fundraiser. One political analyst said, &quot;The party needs him and for all I know, the nation needs him.&quot; Some compared him to John F. Kennedy but Doris Kearns Goodwin warned there were also similarities to William J. Bryan.    Barack Obama is the 5th black Senator in U.S. history. In 2005 he received Harvard Law School's highest award, at which he criticized the Katrina debacle. He published a Time magazine article about President Lincoln. He criticized the Bush administration and called for troop withdrawal from Iraq. In 2006 he met with the Foreign Minister in Israel. First term Senator Obama and senior Senator McCain worked on ethics reform, had a public spat, and made nice. As Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee Vice Chairman, he helped raise $6.5 million. He won a Grammy for his audio book &quot;Dreams of My Father&quot;.    Barak Obama was received like a rock star and hero at a luncheon where he was bestowed the Harvard Law School Association Award. Obama took a 10-day tour of the Middle East that included visits to Iraq, Kuwait, Jordan, Palestinian territories, and Israel. He met with Israeli Foreign Minister Shalom and conveyed to him the United States' support for Israel as its leader Ariel Sharon lay stricken by a stroke. Obama won a Grammy Award for his readings of his autobiographical book Dreams From My Father, which became a best seller as he became a rising political star.    At a sold-out luncheon for black alumni at Harvard Law School, Obama was introduced as a rock star and hero. He urged the nearly 1,000 attendees to take personal responsibility in combating urban poverty. In 2005 Obama called for troop reduction in Iraq and a timeframe for phased withdrawal.

One children's TV network introduced a Saturday afternoon message encouraging children to go out and play. Some schools have expanded physical education programs, yanked junk foods from vending machines and reduced fat in cafeteria food. At least one YMCA has introduced a fitness room designed for pre-teens. Congress has considered legislation to control advertising to children and Kraft Foods promised to stop TV advertising of certain products considered unhealthy to children under 12.    To combat childhood obesity in the US, schools are removing unhealthy food from vending machines, reducing the fat in lunches, and requiring more physical education. New Hampshire is instituting twice-yearly weigh-ins for students. Children's hospitals have weight management programs and a YMCA has a kid-friendly fitness room. Efforts are being made to regulate advertising to young children. Manufacturers offer cereals low in sugar and salt with more vitamins and whole grains. US Cabinet secretaries and children's television networks are promoting healthier lifestyles for children. In New Zealand, schools added a mandatory extra hour of physical activity for students every week.    Scientists say reversing childhood obesity requires wide-ranging efforts. Less time should be spent in front of the computer and television. Schools should remove junk food from vending machines and reduce the fat in cafeteria lunches. Experts recommend reducing sugar consumption. Changes need to be made in food labeling and advertising as well as more school and community recreational facilities and physical education programs. Trainers can help kids who don't enjoy organized sports or who are embarrassed doing active things with fitter kids.      Measures to fight childhood obesity include less time at the TV and computer, changes in food labeling and advertising, more school and community physical education programs and education to help children make better choices. The children's network Nickelodeon is encouraging children to go outside and play. They have also awarded grants to schools to expand physical play. Kraft  will stop TV ads of products unhealthy for children. New Zealand has ordered schools to ensure children take extra physical education.

Cunningham had received cash, cars, rugs, antiques, furniture, yacht club fees, moving expenses and vacations for helping contractors win government contracts. A federal judge sentenced Cunningham to eight years and four months in prison. The government seized Cunningham's share of profits from the $2.6M sale of his home. The IRS will auction the gift items that Cunningham illegally received.   </text> <scu uid=\"1\" label=\"Cunningham resigned from Congress on Nov. 28, 2005\">  <contributor label=\"Cunningham resigned from Congress on Nov. 28, 2005\">   <part label=\"Cunningham resigned from Congress on Nov. 28, 2005\" start=\"61\" end=\"111\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"Rep.

        "summary": "  The National Bureau of Production Safety Supervision and Administration aims to resolve all small coal mine problems within three years. Meanwhile accidents continue. Measures to improve safety include shorter working hours, fire control and ventilation equipment, and a national network of safety inspectors. Automatic gas monitors were installed in 22 gas-rich coal mines. China fired two provincial deputy governors, prosecuted 96 officials and fired or demoted 126 more after accident investigations. China has created a whistleblowers fund to reward citizens reporting negligence and illegal mine investors. Mine safety remains a major challenge as coal represents 67% of China's energy resource.    Government officials have announced that 4,000 small coalmines will be closed by the end of 2005.  One city in north China has imposed huge fines on coalmines for each death in accidents.  In Hunan Province cash awards are offered to those who report officials who illegally own shares in mines.  In December 2005 the government announced that it had dismissed two provincial deputy governors, prosecuted 96 officials and demoted or dismissed 126 other officials blamed for accidents killing 528 people.  Despite such measures the rate of large-scale accidents increases with accidents reported on a near-daily basis.    Accident and death rates continue to increase at China's provincial coal mines, while rates decrease at state-owned facilities. In response, officials will close 4,000 small coal mines annually for three years and further reduce the number through regrouping and mergers. Already, 2,411 mines were closed this year and 12,900 were ordered to suspend production for safety problems. Fines have been established for wrongful deaths, and rewards offered to whistleblowers. Advanced gas monitors were installed in 20-some gas-rich coal mines. Two deputy governors were dismissed, 96 officials were prosecuted, and another 126 officials were demoted or fired for safety violations.    China has set a timetable for solving the problems associated with its thousands of small coalmines. Many of these mines will be closed, an action that won't affect China's demand for coal. Thirteen large coal production bases each capable of turning out 100M tons annually have been approved. In one region, gas monitors have been installed as a safety measure in gas-rich coalmines. Hunan Province is offering cash rewards to people who report on officials who illegally own shares in coalmines. Some officials have been dismissed. By December, 12,990 mines were ordered to stop production due to safety problems. </text> <scu uid=\"187\" label=\"Bur. of Prod.

Being deluged with letters, she spends up to three hours/night at a prison typewriter. She has some duties such as cleaning toilets but is treated with respect and spends most of her time reading and making friends. She takes walks, goes to the gym and watches TV. She has one roommate and is working on innovative ways to do microwave cooking to share with inmates. Her only real complaint is the &quot;terrible&quot; food.

        "summary": "  The State Legislature group concluded that States are focusing cell-phone legislation on younger drivers and school bus drivers. These laws are more likely to pass and maintain their constituents support. The cell-phone industry states that the percentage of accidents caused are very low. Judging cell-phone law results are difficult due to the lack of clear evidence in accidents except from witnesses or driver admissions. Driver education is a large part of cell-phone law enforcement. A National Highway Traffic Safety Administration survey prompted the Department of Defense to restrict driver cell-phone use on military facilities. Enforcement policies vary by military base.      In 2005, 38 states tried to pass legislation restricting cell phones while driving. Bills were passed or are still being considered in 22 states. The National Transportation Safety Board is urging states to restrict young drivers because teens account for a large share of traffic fatalities and cell phone use increases the problem. However, enforcing laws for young drivers is difficult. Both the U.S. Virgin Islands and Lackland Air Force Base have cell phone laws in place.    Every state has considered legislation on cell phones behind the wheel but only a few have banned them unless they are hands-free. Connecticut and Chicago have joined New York, New Jersey and DC in prohibiting use of hand-held phones. Many states have put limits on teens using cell phones while they drive. Enforcement of laws banning cell phone use while driving is a problem. Nearly everyone supports the laws, nearly everyone ignores them. The Defense Department approved restrictions on cell phone use by motorists but left it for the military services and individual bases to decide how to enforce it.    The US Virgin Islands now bans hand-held cell phone use while driving. Eleven states including Colorado, Delaware, Maryland and Tennessee ban cell phone use by young drivers. California prohibits phone use while driving by bus drivers but not others. Under a Pentagon directive, bans on cell phone use while driving are becoming common on military bases. In 2005, 38 states tried to pass restrictive legislation. Effectiveness is difficult to assess because drivers or witnesses must confirm cell phone use coincided with accidents. Enforcement is difficult because officers can't easily ascertain drivers' ages or if they are using hands-free phones. </text> <scu uid=\"26\" label=\"States have tried to pass restrictive

        "summary": "  Prescription drug plan Medicare Part D has been launched with a bombardment of information to seniors. The enrollment period is from November 15 to May 15 with coverage beginning January 1. There may be costly penalties for those that do not sign up by the deadline. The majority of seniors are confused and overwhelmed by all the plan choices. Making the wrong choice has the potential to cost more than they are currently paying. Seniors not computer literate must rely on phone representatives newly trained in the plan details. Many seniors are giving up in frustration and not enrolling.    Benefits from the Medicare Part D prescription drug program will not begin until January 1, 2006, but Medicare beneficiaries may sign up beginning November 15, 2005. The choice is difficult - not just whether to join, but which of a multitude of plans is best for an individual. Choice of the wrong option can endanger benefits already provided by Medicare or other programs. The problem is so baffling that Medicare has established a hotline and a website to help applicants, but users complain that the website is ponderous and the representatives on the hotline are often misinformed.    Medicare Part D enrollment for Medicare beneficiaries began November 15, 2005 though May 15, 2006 for coverage starting January 1, 2006, with a 1% penalty per month for late enrollment. The Part D Drug Discount Card expired May 15. After a $100-million information campaign, 33% of seniors felt informed; 37% thought they would benefit. Seniors choosing a Medicare Part D-approved private drug insurance plan risk loosing their other medical insurance. Employers used Part D federal subsidies to reduce retirees' overall health premiums; others dropped retiree health plans entirely. Of 40 million elderly Medicare beneficiaries, 28 million will enter Part D.    Medicare beneficiaries are eligible for Part D prescription drug coverage. Medicare patients can obtain the drug benefit, which becomes effective January 1, 2006, through two types of private plans: a prescription drug plan (PDP) or a Medicare Advantage plan (MA). If a senior purchases a Part D plan, any prior drug benefit will be voided. The government will not negotiate prices or discounts under the plan. Employers who offer drug coverage to those over 65 are required to provide comparisons of their plan and Part D. Medicare has a hotline and Web site to help people confused by Part D. </text> <scu uid=\"1\" label=\"Medicare beneficiaries are eligible for Part D prescription drug coverage\">  <contributor

        "summary": "  Talks with North Korea reconvened following a five-week break. The U.S. and North Korea remain at a stalemate on the nuclear weapons program. A joint statement was signed with North Korea agreeing to rejoin the Treaty, to permit international inspectors, and to discontinue their nuclear weapons program. No timetable was determined. The international community promised to provide aid, security, energy assistance and work towards improving relations. The day after signing the statement North Korea reversed their decision to cease the weapons program until they receive a light-water reactor to create electricity.    The September 19, 2005 six-nations agreement included: N.K. giving up its nuclear weapons program; returning to the NPT and IAEA safeguards; The U.S. declared no nuclear arms on the Korean Peninsula and no intention to attack N.K.; S.K. reaffirmed it doesn't have and won't deploy nuclear weapons; China, Russia, S.K., the U.S. and Japan agreed give N.K. a light-water reactor; N.K. and the U.S. pledge to respect each other's sovereignty, coexist peacefully, and normalize relations; N.K. and Japan agreed to normalize ties; China, Russia, S.K., Japan and the U.S. gave N.K. energy assistance. Australia offered N.K. energy, aid and expertise.    Talks with North Korea end with the signing of a joint statement. The document states that North Korea agrees to abandon its nuclear weapons programs and return to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in return for recognition of its right to nuclear energy. It also agrees to submit to International Atomic Energy safeguards. China, Russia, South Korea, Japan and the US give North Korea energy assistance and agree to discuss giving a light-water nuclear reactor for generating electricity. North Korea won't dismantle its nuclear program until it receives the reactor.    The six-party talks aimed at getting North Korea to abandon its nuclear programs resumed 13-19 September. Pyongyang pledged to abandon its nuclear programs, to rejoin the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and to follow IAEA safeguards in return for a pledge of aid and security. The U.S agreed not to attack North Korea. China, Russia, South Korea, the U.S., and Japan agreed to give North Korea energy assistance including a light-water reactor. But the deal fell apart almost immediately, when Pyongyang insisted that it would not dismantle its nuclear weapons program until the reactor was built. </text> <scu uid=\"49\" label=\"Talks with NK

        "summary": "  The Jan.30, 2005 election produced only one seat for Christian Parties in the 275-seat Iraq National Assembly. Christians protested irregularities which prevented many from voting. Now the main concern was that minority rights be enshrined in the constitution to be written by the National Assembly. On March 16, 2005 a Christian general in the Iraqi police force was shot dead by a group affiliated with Al-Qaeda. In November in Baghdad gunmen killed four Christian women. Emigration of Iraqi Christians continues with the number since the American takeover estimated from 20,000 to 200,000.    US members of the Iraqi Christian minority living in the US voiced hope for national unity in Iraq's first free elections. Hundreds of Iraqi Christians protested voting irregularities outside of Baghdad's Green Zone. Many polling places opened late or never opened. Those that opened didn't have ballots or election material. Although not written yet, Iraqi Christians fear that the new constitution will favor Islam over Christianity. More killings of Christian Iraqis occur including a Christian general. Yet, they celebrate Christmas and some hope to flee Iraq.    Christians in Mosul protested polls not opening for &quot;security reasons&quot;, keeping 200,000 from voting. Christians won one National Rafidain List seat in the new National Assembly and five spots on Kurdish and PM Alawi tickets. Christians demand the new constitution not be based solely on the Koran and include religious freedom. A Christian police general was assassinated in Kirkuk and four Christian women were murdered in Baghdad. Catholics celebrated a mass for Pope John Paul II. Christmas celebrations became low-key. The Roman Catholic community in Baghdad fell from 60,000 to 5,000. A bombed church was rebuilt with a high wall.     In January elections, Christians won only six seats in the new National Assembly. Outside the Green Zone Christians protested voting irregularities. The 71-member committee drafting the constitution included only one Christian, leading to fears that the document would not recognize minority religious rights. Christians gathered under police protection for a special mass for Pope John Paul II. But violence continued. A Christian police general was killed in Kirkuk. Gunmen killed four Christan women in a Baghdad Christian neighborhood. And some churches were surrounded by tall walls and guarded with rifles. For safety, Christmas midnight mass was held in daylight. </text> <scu uid=\"1\" label=\"Christian parties win only one seat in 275-seat National Assembly for Christian Parties\">  <contributor label=\"Christians won one National Rafidain List seat in the new National Assembly\">   <part label=\"Christians won one National Rafidain List seat in the new National Assembly\" start=\"1434\" end=\"1509\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"one seat for Christian Parties in the 275-seat Iraq National Assembly\">   <part label=\"one seat for Christian Parties in the 275-seat Iraq National Assembly\" start=\"101\" end=\"170\"/>  </contributor> </scu> <scu uid=\"2\" label=\"Christians won five spots on Kurdish and PM Alawi tickets\">  <contributor label=\"five spots on Kurdish and PM Alawi tickets\">   <part label=\"five spots on Kurdish and PM Alawi tickets\" start=\"1514\" end=\"1556\"/>  </contributor> </scu> <scu uid=\"3\" label=\"Christians won only six seats in the new National Assembly\">  <contributor label=\"Christians won only six seats in the new National Assembly\">   <part label=\"Christians won only six seats in the new National Assembly\" start=\"2049\" end=\"2107\"/>  </contributor> </scu> <scu uid=\"4\" label=\"Christians protested irregularities\">  <contributor label=\"Christians protested voting irregularities\">   <part label=\"Christians protested voting irregularities\" start=\"852\" end=\"894\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"Christians protested voting irregularities\">   <part label=\"Christians protested voting irregularities\" start=\"2132\" end=\"2174\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"Christians protested irregularities\">   <part label=\"Christians protested irregularities\" start=\"172\" end=\"207\"/>  </contributor> </scu> <scu uid=\"5\" label=\"many prevented many from voting\">  <contributor label=\"prevented many from voting\">   <part label=\"prevented many from voting\" start=\"214\" end=\"240\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"Many polling places opened late or never opened\">   <part label=\"Many polling places opened late or never opened\" start=\"928\" end=\"975\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"Christians in Mosul protested polls not opening for &quot;security reasons&quot;, keeping 200,000 from voting\">   <part label=\"Christians in Mosul protested polls not opening for &quot;security reasons&quot;, keeping 200,000 from voting\" start=\"1333\" end=\"1432\"/>  </contributor> </scu> <scu uid=\"6\" label=\"Those that opened didn't have ballots or election material\">  <contributor label=\"Those that opened didn't have ballots or election material\">   <part label=\"Those that opened didn't have ballots or election material\" start=\"977\" end=\"1035\"/>  </contributor> </scu> <scu uid=\"7\" label=\"Christians want minority rights enshrined in the constitution\">  <contributor label=\"minority rights be enshrined in the constitution\">   <part label=\"minority rights be enshrined in the constitution\" start=\"272\" end=\"320\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"Christians demand the new constitution not be based solely on the Koran and include religious freedom...leading to fears that the document would not recognize minority religious rights\">   <part label=\"Christians demand the new constitution not be based solely on the Koran and include religious freedom\" start=\"1558\" end=\"1659\"/>   <part label=\"leading to fears that the document would not recognize minority religious rights\" start=\"2255\" end=\"2335\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"Iraqi Christians fear that the new constitution will favor Islam over Christianity\">   <part label=\"Iraqi Christians fear that the new constitution will favor Islam over Christianity\" start=\"1063\" end=\"1145\"/>  </contributor> </scu> <scu uid=\"8\" label=\"a Christian general in the Iraqi police force was shot dead\">  <contributor label=\"a Christian general in the Iraqi police force was shot dead\">   <part label=\"a Christian general in the Iraqi police force was shot dead\" start=\"379\" end=\"438\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"A Christian police general was assassinated in Kirkuk\">   <part label=\"A Christian police general was assassinated in Kirkuk\" start=\"1661\" end=\"1714\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"A Christian police general was killed in Kirkuk\">   <part label=\"A Christian police general was killed in Kirkuk\" start=\"2447\" end=\"2494\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"More killings of Christian Iraqis occur including a Christian general.

        "summary": "  Russia restored the reduced gas flow through Ukrainian pipelines which had sparked emergencies throughout Europe raising questions about Russia's reliability. The reduction was critically viewed as a foreign policy tool. Ukraine, accused of gas theft, responded that the withdrawal was routine. Russia was charged with acts of terror in pipeline explosions in Georgia. Croatia and Hungary are considering an Adriatic Sea pipeline to decrease reliance on Russia. The European Union imports some gas from Russia but parts of Europe are mainly Russia dependent. A proposed trans-Caspian pipeline linking gas directly to the West bypassing Russia is causing renewed conflicts.    Gazprom intends to remain the leading gas supplier to Europe and to expand its markets. However, Russia's disruption of gas supplies to Europe during freezing weather raised concerns about the company's ability to ensure steady fuel supplies. Pipelines supplying Russian gas go through Ukraine and each country blames the other for the shortage. Croatia and Hungary are weighing construction of a pipeline from the Adriatic Sea to bring Middle Eastern gas to Europe and decrease reliance on Russian gas. Russia has opposed a US-backed pipeline project that would bypass Russia and link Central Asian gas fields directly to the West.    Faced with mounting criticism, Russia restored gas withheld from Ukraine in an alleged pricing dispute but suspected to be Moscow's meddling in Ukraine's internal politics. Steady fuel supplies from Gazprom became questioned. Austria proposed a gas pipeline from Iran to Austria as part of Nabucco. Gas pipeline explosions in January 2006 were blamed on both Moscow and terrorists. Croatia and Hungary are considering a liquified petroleum gas terminal on the Adriatic coast and a pipeline to Europe to decrease reliance on Russian gas. A US-backed trans-Caspian pipeline is proposed that would bring Central Asian gas to Europe and bypass Russia.    Russia cut the flow of natural gas through the Ukrainian pipeline in early January because of a pricing dispute. The resulting European energy crisis made European governments question Russia's reliability and seek alternative sources. Austria is weighing the construction of a pipeline from Iran through Turkey and the Balkans. Croatia and Hungary are considering a pipeline to bring liquid gas from North Africa and the Middle East. The U.S.supports a proposed pipeline under the Caspian Sea to bring gas from Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan through Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey. Pipeline explosions cut Russia's gas supply to Georgia and Armenia. </text> <scu uid=\"1\" label=\"Russia withheld gas.\">  <contributor label=\"Russia...restored gas withheld from Ukraine\">   <part

        "summary": "  On Oct. 27, 2005, a little more than three weeks after offering the nomination of Harriet Miers, President Bush announced that she had withdrawn her nomination. Many expressed sympathy for how she had been treated. Republicans, including Miers herself, blamed failure of the nomination on the Senate Judiciary Committee's demands for documents from the White House, but the committee chair denied intruding on executive privilege. Democrats blamed the failure on right-wing ideologues. Sen. Lott (R-MS) blamed it on a nomination based on cronyism. On Oct. 28 President Bush said he would quickly select another candidate.    Harriet Miers withdrew her nomination from consideration as a Supreme Court justice. Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee questioned her conservative credentials, lack of judicial experience and criticized her for not completely answering a questionnaire about her work at the White House. Others said the White House bungled the nomination from the start. Many agreed that although she is a very capable person, President Bush shouldn't have chosen someone not qualified to serve on the Supreme Court.     President Bush announced that Harriet Miers had withdrawn her nomination for the Supreme Court. The announcement was met with a blend of regret, relief and a feeling that she had been treated poorly. Miers said her withdrawal was to avoid burdening the White House over access to documents on advice she gave Bush since lawmakers had requested those documents. Some senators said that she had been the victim of bad handling and the White House had capitulated to the far right wing of the Republican Party. Right Wing partisans expressed relief and some jubilation at her withdrawal.    Harriet Miers withdrew her nomination to the Supreme Court three and a half weeks after its initial announcement. Bush declared on 27 October that his choice had withdrawn her name and that he had &quot;reluctantly accepted&quot; her decision. She claimed that the fight over her nomination would be a burden for the White House. She also said that she wanted to protect the independence of the executive branch, citing the battle over access to her White House legal writings. She will continue to serve as White House counsel. Bush promised to name a replacement &quot;in a timely manner.&quot; </text> <scu uid=\"1\" label=\"Harriet Miers withdrew her nomination to the Supreme Court.\">  <contributor label=\"President Bush announced that she had withdrawn her nomination\">   <part label=\"President Bush announced that she had withdrawn her nomination\" start=\"158\" end=\"220\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"Harriet Miers had withdrawn her nomination for the Supreme Court\">   <part label=\"Harriet Miers had withdrawn her nomination for the Supreme Court\" start=\"1336\" end=\"1400\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"Harriet Miers withdrew her nomination to the Supreme Court\">   <part label=\"Harriet Miers withdrew her nomination to the Supreme Court\" start=\"1948\" end=\"2006\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"Harriet Miers withdrew her nomination from consideration as a Supreme Court justice\">   <part label=\"Harriet Miers withdrew her nomination from consideration as a Supreme Court justice\" start=\"740\" end=\"823\"/>  </contributor> </scu> <scu uid=\"3\" label=\"Many expressed sympathy for how she had been treated\">  <contributor label=\"Many expressed sympathy for how she had been treated\">   <part label=\"Many expressed sympathy for how she had been treated\" start=\"222\" end=\"274\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"The announcement was met with...feeling that she had been treated poorly...Some senators said that she had been the victim of bad handling\">   <part label=\"The announcement was met with\" start=\"1402\" end=\"1431\"/>   <part label=\"feeling that she had been treated poorly\" start=\"1464\" end=\"1504\"/>   <part label=\"Some senators said that she had been the victim of bad handling\" start=\"1667\" end=\"1730\"/>  </contributor> </scu> <scu uid=\"9\" label=\"President Bush announced that she had withdrawn her nomination\">  <contributor label=\"President Bush announced that she had withdrawn her nomination\">   <part label=\"President Bush announced that she had withdrawn her nomination\" start=\"158\" end=\"220\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"Bush declared...that his choice had withdrawn her name\">   <part label=\"Bush declared\" start=\"2062\" end=\"2075\"/>   <part label=\"that his choice had withdrawn her name\" start=\"2090\" end=\"2128\"/>  </contributor> </scu> <scu uid=\"5\" label=\"President Bush said he would select another candidate quickly\">  <contributor label=\"On Oct. 28 President Bush said he would quickly select another candidate\">   <part label=\"On Oct. 28 President Bush said he would quickly select another candidate\" start=\"609\" end=\"681\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"Bush promised to name a replacement &quot;in a timely manner.&quot;\">   <part label=\"Bush promised to name a replacement &quot;in a timely manner.&quot;\" start=\"2467\" end=\"2524\"/>  </contributor> </scu> <scu uid=\"4\" label=\"Some Republicans, including Miers herself, blamed failure of the nomination on the Senate Judiciary Committee's demands for documents from the White House\">  <contributor label=\"Republicans, including Miers herself, blamed failure of the nomination on the Senate Judiciary Committee's demands for documents from the White House\">   <part label=\"Republicans, including Miers herself, blamed failure of the nomination on the Senate Judiciary Committee's demands for documents from the White House\" start=\"276\" end=\"425\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"Miers said her withdrawal was to avoid burdening the White House over access to documents on advice she gave Bush since lawmakers had requested those documents\">   <part label=\"Miers said her withdrawal was to avoid burdening the White House over access to documents on advice she gave Bush since lawmakers had requested those documents\" start=\"1506\" end=\"1665\"/>  </contributor> </scu> <scu uid=\"2\" label=\"The withdrawal came a little more than three weeks after the nomination was made.\">  <contributor label=\"a little more than three weeks after offering the nomination of Harriet Miers\">   <part label=\"a little more than three weeks after offering the nomination of Harriet Miers\" start=\"79\" end=\"156\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"three and a half weeks after its initial announcement\">   <part label=\"three and a half weeks after its initial announcement\" start=\"2007\" end=\"2060\"/>  </contributor> </scu> <scu uid=\"21\" label=\"Bush said that he had &quot;reluctantly accepted&quot;

The League's testing program is weak compared to World Anti-Doping Agency standards. Lawmakers are considering stronger action if the League does not impose mandatory bans to police the League.    Major League Baseball players who have admitted to using steroids include Ken Caminiti, Mark McGwire and Jose Conseco. Players suspected of steroid use include Barry Bonds, Sammy Sosa, Jason Giambi, Rafael Palmeiro, Ivan Rodriguez and Juan Gonzalez. MLB's recently toughened penalties of fines from $10,000 to $100,000 and suspensions from 10 days to one year are far below international anti-doping standards. US lawmakers passed the Anabolic Steroid Control Act which added steroid precursors to the list of controlled substances. In their investigation of steroid use in Major League Baseball, lawmakers found the penalties for positive steroid tests inadequate.    After the death of former baseball star Ken Caminiti, an admitted steroid user, the US House of Representatives amended the Controlled Substances Act to include additional types of steroids. Major league baseball players who are accused of, or admitted, using steroids are Mark McGuire, Jose Canseco, Barry Bonds Sammy Sosa, Jason Giambi and Raphael Palmiero. Commissioner Bud Selig said that the testing program in place for two years showed a drop in positive tests for steroids. That program has been criticized as too lenient. Baseball executives and players union leaders have agreed to toughen penalties for the current season.    Major League Baseball players Ken Caminiti, Mark McGwire, and Jose Canseco admitted taking steroids. Barry Bonds, Sammy Sosa, Jason Giambi, Rafael Palmeiro, Ivan Rodriguez, and Juan Gonzalez are accused or suspected of steroid use. Caminiti claimed half the players used them. 5-7 percent of players tested positive in 2003 and 1-2 percent in 2005. Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig investigated steroid use in 1998 and urged banning over-the-counter sales. A pamphlet in English and Spanish on steroids' effects was distributed to players. Drug tests for players began in 2004. Some steroids became controlled substances. Congress held hearings on baseball steroid use. </text> <scu uid=\"1\" label=\"Congress held hearings on baseball steroid use\">  <contributor label=\"Congress held hearings on baseball steroid use\">

        "summary": "  The distress of Hurricane Katrina evacuees forced to choose between rescue and pets has prompted a review of disaster preparedness. Evacuees expected to return within days to rescue their pets instead of the weeks that have passed. Humane and animal welfare organizations are mounting search and rescue efforts and providing shelter and medical treatment. They have requested federal, state and local assistance. Soldiers are being re-deployed for animal rescue. More than 4,000 animals have been rescued with some being sheltered in other states. Animals are micro-chipped and photographed to assist in reunification. Monetary and animal supplies donations are continuing.    Hundreds of animal welfare workers and volunteers from the gulf coast and across the nation are working to rescue pets stranded by Hurricane Katrina. The Humane Society, SPCA and other organizations have joined the effort. The ASPCA has received donations of over $5.25 million, and shipments of food and supplies. Nearly 4,000 animals have been rescued, and 300-400 have been reunited with their owners. Hundreds of animals arrive daily at the Lamar-Dixon Center in Gonzales, LA where about 2,000 are housed. The animals are photographed, micro chipped and documented before being shipped to other shelters. Pictures are posted on Petfinder.com.    Hurricane Katrina evacuees were forced to abandon possibly 50,000 dogs, cats, birds and other pets. Volunteers with the Humane Society, the ASPCA, other groups, and soldiers searched for pets trapped in houses and left food for animals roaming streets. Rescued pets were taken to Gonzales, LA and Hattiesburg, MS. 4,000 pets had been rescued by 9/13/05 and a small fraction reunited with owners. To ease overcrowding some dogs were relocated to other states after being photographed, microchipped and documented. Pet photographs were posted on the website petfinder.com. Federal, state and local assistance was requested. The ASPCA received over $5.25 million.    Hurricane Katrina has left thousands of animals stranded in New Orleans. Many pet owners were forced to abandon their animals in the evacuation of the city, although some owners stayed, refusing to leave without their pets. The Humane Scociety and the SPCA are doing their best to rescue the animals, which include dogs, cats, horses, reptiles, and even a sea lion and a tarantula. Web sites are being used to try to reunite pets and their owners. And many animals are being photographed, microchipped, and documented and then shipped to shelters and foster homes in other states. </text> <scu uid=\"263\" label=\"thousands of animals stranded in

        "summary": "  Investigations of lobbyist Jack Abramoff and his partner Michael Scanlon by the Senate Indian Affairs Committee in 2004 resulted in other investigations. The pair's lobbying for Indian tribes and Pacific islanders was shown to have benefitted the lobbyists and political associates while bilking the clients of millions of dollars. The House majority leader and a congressman were implicated. On Nov. 18, 2005 Michael Scanlon was charged with fraud and scheduled to go to court on a conspiracy count contained in a criminal information, typically a prelude to pleading guilty and giving full cooperation with government investigators.    Republican lobbyist Jack Abramoff and his associate Michael Scanlon are at the center of a growing corruption scandal. The investigation began with allegations of fraud in dealings with a number of American Indian tribes, but widened to include golf junkets and dealings in the Northern Marianas. The scandal has focused attention on a number of members of Congress and their associates, including House Majority Leader Tom DeLay of Texas and Rep. Robert Ney of Ohio. Abramoff has been arrested on fraud charges stemming from a Florida deal. Scanlon is expected to plead guilty to charges and cooperate with government investigators.    The Senate Indian Affairs Committee charged Jack Abramoff, a GOP lobbyist and fund-raiser, with running a crude extortion racket that has bilked tribes out of millions of dollars. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, additional congressmen and House aides are under an ethics investigation resulting from their connections with Abramoff. His activities in the Northern Marianas are also being investigated. Abramoff has been indicated in federal court on six counts of fraud and conspiracy and his partner, Michael Scanlon, was charged with defrauding Indian tribes of millions of dollars.     Republican lobbyist Jack Abramoff is being investigated in connection with manipulating elections and extorting lobbying fees of $66 million from six Indian tribes related to protecting gaming franchises, and $9 million from the Northern Mariana Islands related to the textile industry. Investigations also involve Abramoff's purchase of a gambling cruise ship company and arranging unreported golf junkets to Scotland. Abramoff invoked the Fifth Amendment before a Senate hearing. Also implicated are Republican Majority Leader Tom DeLay, his former aide Michael Scanlon, Ralph Reed, Representative Robert W. Ney, and David Safavian. Safavian was indicted in connection with a golf trip.  </text> <scu uid=\"1\" label=\"Jack Abramoff is a  GOP lobbyist\">  <contributor label=\"Jack Abramoff, a GOP lobbyist\">   <part label=\"Jack

        "summary": "  On March 24, 2005 mass protests outside the presidential compound in Bishkek turned violent. Demonstrators broke into the building and beat several officials severely. Akayev fled the country for Russia and soon announced in Moscow that he would resign if the Kyrgyzstan government would guarantee his safety. On April 3 a Kyrgyzstan parliamentary delegation arrived in Moscow and after 3 hours of talks Akayev signed a resignation document. He also taped an 18-minute farewell address to be played in Bishkek while he remained in Moscow. New presidential elections are scheduled for June 26.    On March 24, 2005 protestors stormed the main Kyrgystan government building and Akayev fled to Russia. The elected pro-Akayev parliament nonetheless elected an Akayev opponent as Speaker and called for new presidential elections on June 26. On April 3, Akayev signed his resignation in Moscow, which was notarized in lieu of a constitutional requirement that he present his resignation in person to parliament. Because his safety still could not be guaranteed, due to continued calls for his impeachment, his recorded resignation was to be heard and accepted by a special session of parliament on April 6 and broadcast live.    Opposition against Akayev strengthened with international criticism for election abuses, his government's crackdown on opposition groups and independent media, and his failure to bring those responsible for killing six peaceful demonstrators in 2002 to justice. Poverty and widespread corruption contributed to public anger. Akayev fled to Russia after opposition supporters stormed the main government building and mobs looted parts of Bishkek. He resigned as president in Moscow, with impeachment the alternative. In his address to the nation, Akayev apologized to people who bore him grudges, hoped the presidential election would be democratic, and said he wouldn't fight the new government.    Massive uprisings continued in Kyrgyzstan, fueled by anger over the rigged parliamentary elections. When protesters finally stormed the presidential compound on 30 March, President Akayev fled to Moscow. Two nights of looting and gunfire followed in Bishkek. A delegation headed by the new speaker of Parliament went to Moscow to negotiate with Akayev. Akayev signed his formal resignation at the Kyrgyz Embassy in Moscow on 4 April. His recorded statement was to be shown to Parliament and then broadcast on national television. Presidential elections are now scheduled for 26 June. </text> <scu uid=\"7\" label=\"Akayev fled the country for Russia.\">  <contributor label=\"Akayev fled the country for Russia\">   <part

        "summary": "  U.S. District Judge Joan Humphrey Lefkow's mother and husband were shot at her home in an apparent retaliation for her contempt order against Matthew Hale, a previous defendant in a civil copyright lawsuit with white supremacist elements. Hale is currently in federal prison awaiting sentencing for previously soliciting the murder of Lefkow. Federal agents and police are investigating Hale's colleagues and looking for two men seen near Lefkow's home at the time of the murders. Evidence recovered at the scene include: shell casings, a fingerprint, footprint, and cigarette butts. Hale denies any involvement in the murders.     Judge Joan Humphrey Lefkow's husband and mother were murdered in their home on February 28. They died of multiple gunshot wounds between 10:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. Evidence being analyzed includes broken window glass with a fingerprint, a bloody footprint, .22-caliber shell casings, a bloody mop and cigarette butts. Investigators released composite sketches of two men seen near the home on the day of the killings. A $50,000 reward is being offered for leads in the case. The prime suspect is domestic extremist Matthew Hale, convicted last year of soliciting her murder. He and his supporters deny any involvement.    Once white supremacist Matthew Hale was convicted and in jail for plotting to kill Judge Joan Lefkow, her security detail was dropped. Killers entered her house, had her husband and mother lie on the basement floor, and shot each to death. Police and FBI investigated widely but focused on Hale and his violent supporters. Evidence included a window shard with a fingerprint, a bloody mop and shoeprint, cigarette butts, and 22-caliber shell casings. Witness sightings of two white men waiting in a red Ford Escort produced composite sketches. Investigators seized communication and computer records and offered a $50,000 reward.    The husband and mother of U.S. District Judge Joan Lefkow were killed in the basement of her Chicago home on 28 February. Investigators found a bloody footprint and fingerprints butts at the scene. There are no suspects. Investigators have questioned relatives, friends, and supporters of Matthew Hale, the leader of a large white supremacist group, who was convicted last year of obstruction of justice and of ordering Lefkow's killing. They also want to question two men seen in a car illegally parked near the home that afternoon. A $50,000 reward has been offered for information in the case. </text> <scu uid=\"13\" label=\"Evidence - cigarette butts\">  <contributor label=\"Evidence recovered at the scene include...cigarette

        "summary": "  Herceptin reduced HER2-positive gene-associated breast cancer recurrences 52 percent. Avastin proved effective against breast cancer. Low-grade ductal carcinoma in situ becomes invasive cancer in 40 percent of patients over 40 years. Combined chemotherapy and hormone therapy cut death in half within 15 years from recurring breast cancer. Consuming 33.3 fat grams daily reduces breast cancer recurrence 30% over five years. Exercise increases breast cancer survival 50%. Low melatonin levels in night-time workers increased breast cancer. Benign &quot;proliferative&quot; lesions correlate with later breast cancer. At 65 and older, early smaller localized tumors accounted for 96% of survival improvement; 38% under 50.    The drug Herceptin will soon be added to chemotherapy as a standard part of post surgical treatment for some breast cancer patients. Scientists reported that breast cancer patients who follow diets low in fat might reduce the chance that their tumors will return. A study showed that walking for three to five hours per week reduced the risk of death by 50 percent. Another study examining the role of childhood diet plays in breast cancer found an association between eating French fries regularly during the preschool years and developing breast cancer as an adult.    Risk of dying from breast cancer fell because drugs prevent recurrence and earlier-detected tumors are smaller. Herceptin halves risk of recurrence in women with tumors high in protein HER2. A low-fat diet and exercise may reduce chances of recurrence. Only removing the lymph node nearest a cancer is less invasive and accurately detects whether cancer has spread. Ductal carcinoma in situ has various grades, can be mistaken as benign, and can take 40 years to develop. Night shift workers, women with benign breast lesions, and girls who frequently ate French fries as preschoolers have a higher risk of breast cancer.     Breast cancer survival rates have improved because of better screening, leading to detection of smaller tumors when the cancer is still localized. There are two new drugs for breast cancer - herceptin and avastin. Scientists see a link between benign breast cancer lesions and later cancer. Studies have shown that both low-fat diets and exercise can increase survival rates for  breast cancer patients. But eating french fries in childhood can lead to cancer in adulthood. Night workers seem to have a higher incidence of breast cancer, indicating that there may be a relationship between tumor developent and exposure to light. </text> <scu uid=\"1\" label=\"Herceptin

        "summary": "  Rove remains under investigation. News organizations are requesting that the court refuse Fitzgerald's motion to keep pretrial evidence confidential. Plame is leaving the CIA. Senator Charles Schumer requested that President Bush reveal who illegally leaked Plame's identity. Libby's trial has been set to begin in January. Libby's lawyers seek dismissal of charges against him saying that Fitzgerald did not have the legal authority to indict Libby. By court order, edited government documents related to intelligence briefings will be provided to Libby for his defense. Fitzgerald opposed the request to dismiss the case saying he had the legal authority to indict.    After Libby's indictment, reporter Bob Woodward told Special Prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald that about one month before Valerie Plame's identity was exposed, he had learned it from another Bush administration official (not Libby). Karl Rove revealed Plame's identify to Time magazine reporter Matt Cooper days before Libby revealed it to columnist Robert Novak. Portions of the Plame identity leak investigation's grand jury testimony were unsealed. Libby had told the grand jury that Vice President Cheney had authorized him to leak classified information. Fitzgerald disputed Libby's motion to a federal judge to dismiss his indictment, claiming the Prosecutor was appointed unconstitutionally.     Washington Post editor Bob Woodward acknowledged that a senior WH official, other than Scooter Libby, had told him Plame was a CIA operative before it was reported by Novak. Plame resigned from the CIA since her outing diminished her career possibilities. Karl Rove remains under investigation; he disclosed that he had told a Time magazine reporter of Plame's CIA status. Libby's attorneys continue to argue for dismissal of the case against him. It was reported that Libby will argue that Chaney authorized him to leak classified information to bolster the case for war against Iraq.    Libby's lawyers have asked a federal judge to dismiss the indictment, claiming that the prosecutor lacked the legal authority to indict Libby. The Special Counsel disputes that claim. Libby's trial has been set for January 2007. He is expected to testify that he was too involved with national security issues to recall minor events such as conversations with reporters. A federal judge has ordered the government to provide Libby with redacted versions of various documents and other information he requested. Meanwhile the special prosecutor is back at work before another grand jury with Rove still under investigation. </text> <scu uid=\"1\" label=\"Rove remains under investigation\">  <contributor

        "summary": "  Other power grid vulnerabilities include accidental line cuts during maintenance, equipment malfunction or failure, old grid infrastructure and poor grid design causing power loss over wider areas. Improvements in grid architectures will increase network resilience. Deregulation resulted in lower margins for reserve power capacity and transmission capacity, as well as loss of experienced personnel. As companies specialized more in generation or transmission, supervisory data became proprietary and unavailable to regional grid managers. An August 2005 federal law will create a process for mandating reliability rules. Energy conservation and smart appliances that cut back during power grid stresses can avert blackouts.    The blackout in August 2003 that struck the northeastern U.S. and parts of Canada was primarily caused by the deregulation of the utility companies. Experts said that changes in the industry had several adverse effects, including loss of experienced personnel and lawyers and MBAs now heading these competitive companies rather than engineers. Power plant capacity and its state of repair are proprietary now and not available to system operators who manage regional power grids. The energy law provides for mandatory reliability rules, but no power to enforce rules.    The factor widely considered behind the blackout of 2003 is the deregulation of the electric system. Under a regulated system, utilities could add transmission lines to increase reliability and their costs would be reimbursed through the regulatory process. Market participants prefer lower margins to drive up prices. A new energy bill now provides a mechanism for creating mandatory reliability rules. Some firms have identified advances in technology: cheap, powerful chips, more capable software and broadband communications that will impact on the energy business. Power saving devices and developing alternate power sources can contribute to the reliability of the power system.    California imposed rolling power cuts in 2001 to deal with strains on the grid. In 2005 Los Angeles suffered three significant electrical failures, due to mistakes by workers or automatic systems. In 2005 the US and Canada discussed deregulation of the electric system, widely considered to be a cause of the 2003 blackout. Utilities now have little incentive to invest in transmission lines, keep reserve power to minimize shortages, or share information on power plant operating status. Plants operate closer to reliability limits more often. MBAs and lawyers head power companies rather than engineers. Energy company ownership continues to consolidate. </text> <scu uid=\"1\" label=\"Deregulation of the electric system caused the 2003 blackout.\">  <contributor label=\"The factor widely considered

India will build the satellite and France the scientific instruments. ISRO is also considering scientific experiments from the US, UK, Sweden, Bulgaria and Germany for an unmanned lunar mission. India hopes to launch a manned mission within seven years. ISRO is assisting the Jharkhand Space Application Center launch a telemedicine satellite system to connect doctors with rural communities. Afghanistan is requesting to piggyback on the telemedicine system to assist their citizens.    The space agencies of India and France have signed an agreement to cooperate in launching a satellite that will help make climate predictions more accurate. The Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) has short-listed experiments from the US, UK, Sweden. Bulgaria and Germany for a slot on its unmanned moon mission, Chandrayaan-1. The European Space Agency and NASA will have x-ray and laser equipment on the satellite. The ISRO will provide satellite connectivity to the Jharkhand Space Application Center for a telemedicine system to connect villagers with doctors at renowned hospitals. This network will also function in Afghanistan.    The Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) and France will cooperate on a satellite to track tropical atmospheric conditions. ISRO has short-listed experiments from five nations (US, UK, Sweden, Bulgaria, Germany) for a slot on India's unmanned moon mission, Chandrayaan-1, which is to map the lunar surface. India can send a man into space within seven years. Its first astronaut flew on the Soviet Salyut 7 in 1984. Another died in the Columbia shuttle disaster. India plans a telemedicine system to connect hospitals and patients via satellite. India plans flight-testing of its cryogenic rocket. It sought black-market electrical components for rockets.    India's space program is developing on several fronts. India is planning an unmanned moon mission to map the moon's surface and produce a chemical map of the moon. Experiments from five countries (the U.S. and four European nations) are short-listed for this satellite. It has an agreement with France to launch a satelite perhaps in 2008 to make climate predictions more accurate. It will set up a telemedicine system, linking doctors at the best hospitals with patients across India. Afghanistan has asked India for help setting up a similar program in Afghanistan using Indian satellites. </text> <scu uid=\"1\" label=\"The Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) and France will

        "summary": "  The 7 year legal battles between the husband and parents of Florida resident Terri Schiavo over whether to extend her life artificially continue with day to day countermanding legal rulings including Florida's Supreme Court. Florida's Governor, Jeb Bush, intervened for the parents. The U.S. Supreme Court has refused involvement. State rulings for the husband ordered the immediate removal of Shiavo's feeding tube. The U.S. Congress met in emergency sessions on behalf of the parents to write legislation allowing a federal court to hear the case.      Terri Schiavo's husband and legal guardian Michael Schiavo is involved in a seven-year court battle with her parents. Mr. Schiavo has fought for legal permission to remove her feeding tube, which has kept her alive for 15 years. Some doctors testified that Terri Schiavo is in a persistent vegetative state after a sudden heart attack, with no hope for recovery. Her parents insist that she be kept alive. She had no living will or written instructions. The legal battle in Florida is complex. A judge instructed that the tube be removed on March 18, 2005.    Michael Schiavo's legal battle to have his long-comatose wife Terri's feeding tube removed against her parents' wishes began in 1993. Courts ordered it removed in 2000 and 2003. Six days after a 2003 removal it was reinserted after Governor Jeb Bush pushed &quot;Terri's law&quot; through the Florida Legislature. Florida's Supreme Court struck this down as unconstitutional. The US Supreme Court declined to get involved. Florida Judge George Greer ordered the tube be disconnected on 3/18/05, rebuffing US congressional intervention efforts as having no jurisdiction. Congress then passed narrow legislation allowing Terri's parents to appeal to federal courts for tube reinsertion.    The seven-year legal battle continues over the fate of Terri Schiavo, who has been in a vegetative state for over 15 years. Doctors say that there is no hope of recovery. Her parents want to keep her alive; her husband who is her legal guardian says that she would not want to be kept alive artificially. The case is complicated and has involved state courts at several levels, both state and federal legislatures, and the governor of Florida as well as the U.S. President. As of 19 March the feeding tube had been removed by court order. </text> <scu uid=\"18\" label=\"Terri Schiavo has heart attack \">  <contributor label=\"Terri Schiavo...sudden heart attack\">   <part

        "summary": "  During the morning rush hour on July 7, terrorists exploded bombs on three London subway trains and a double-decker bus, killing at least 52 and injuring 700. A group called Secret al-Qaida Jihad Organization in Europe claimed responsibility. The attacks were timed to coincide with the G-8 summit meeting at Gleneagles, Scotland. Forensic evidence indicates that each bomb contained less than 10 pounds of possibly military-grade high explosives, and all were made by a single bomb maker. There is not yet evidence as to whether suicide bombers were involved. Police are close to identifying someone responsible for the bus attack.    Four coordinated bombings struck central London on July 7, three in subway cars and one on a bus. The blasts killed 52 persons and sent 350 to hospitals where 22 remain critical. An additional 350 were treated for light injuries. Hot, dusty conditions in subway tunnels hampered rescue operations. PM Tony Blair returned to London from the Group of Eight meeting in Scotland after the bombings. Police said each bomb contained less than ten pounds of military-grade explosives and did not rule out suicide bombers as responsible. A group called Secret al-Qaida Jihad Organization in Europe claimed responsibility.    Four coordinated bombs exploded in central London during morning rush hour on July 7th, coinciding with the G8 summit in Scotland. About 700 were injured and 52 killed. Three bombs were on subway trains and one on a bus. Each was small enough to fit in a rucksack. The Secret al-Qaida Jihad Organization in Europe claimed responsibility, to avenge British involvement in wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. No evidence arose of suicide bombers. Investigators viewed video by cameras on streets and subway platforms around London. Londoners took the terrorist attacks in stride, used to IRA bombs and the WWII blitz.    Four coordinated terrorist attacks occurred in London during the morning rush hour on Thursday 7 July. Bombs exploded on three subway trains and one double-decker bus. The bombs all contained similar components: military-grade explosives under 10 pounds, small enough to fit into a backpack. The explosions killed at least 52 people and injured more than 700. Investigations at the tunnel site were slow, hampered by very high heat, asbestos dust, and twisted metal. Investigators do not know how many suspects they are looking for, but reported progress toward identifying one of the bombers. </text> <scu uid=\"7\" label=\"Double-decker bus bombed\">  <contributor label=\"terrorists exploded bombs on...a double-decker bus\">   <part label=\"a double-decker bus\" start=\"161\" end=\"180\"/>   <part label=\"terrorists exploded bombs on\" start=\"101\" end=\"129\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"bombings struck central London...one on a bus\">   <part label=\"one on a bus\" start=\"835\" end=\"847\"/>   <part label=\"bombings struck central London\" start=\"768\" end=\"798\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"bombs...one on a bus\">   <part label=\"one on a bus\" start=\"1629\" end=\"1641\"/>   <part label=\"bombs\" start=\"1597\" end=\"1602\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"Bombs exploded on...one double-decker bus\">   <part label=\"one double-decker bus\" start=\"2234\" end=\"2255\"/>   <part label=\"Bombs exploded on\" start=\"2192\" end=\"2209\"/>  </contributor> </scu> <scu uid=\"3\" label=\"Bombs exploded in London\">  <contributor label=\"exploded bombs...London\">   <part label=\"exploded bombs\" start=\"112\" end=\"126\"/>   <part label=\"London\" start=\"136\" end=\"142\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"bombings struck central London\">   <part label=\"bombings struck central London\" start=\"768\" end=\"798\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"bombs exploded in central London\">   <part label=\"bombs exploded in central London\" start=\"1439\" end=\"1471\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"in London...Bombs exploded\">   <part label=\"Bombs exploded\" start=\"2192\" end=\"2206\"/>   <part label=\"in London\" start=\"2133\" end=\"2142\"/>  </contributor> </scu> <scu uid=\"6\" label=\"3 subway trains bombed\">  <contributor label=\"exploded bombs on three London subway trains\">   <part label=\"exploded bombs on three London subway trains\" start=\"112\" end=\"156\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"bombings struck central London on July 7, three in subway cars\">   <part label=\"bombings struck central London on July 7, three in subway cars\" start=\"768\" end=\"830\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"Three bombs were on subway trains\">   <part label=\"Three bombs were on subway trains\" start=\"1591\" end=\"1624\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"Bombs exploded on three subway trains\">   <part label=\"Bombs exploded on three subway trains\" start=\"2192\" end=\"2229\"/>  </contributor> </scu> <scu uid=\"15\" label=\"4 coordinated attacks occurred\">  <contributor label=\"Four coordinated terrorist attacks occurred\">   <part label=\"Four coordinated terrorist attacks occurred\" start=\"2089\" end=\"2132\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"Four coordinated bombs exploded\">   <part label=\"Four coordinated bombs exploded\" start=\"1422\" end=\"1453\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"Four coordinated bombings struck\">   <part label=\"Four coordinated bombings struck\" start=\"751\" end=\"783\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"exploded bombs on three London subway trains and a double-decker bus\">   <part label=\"exploded bombs on three London subway trains and a double-decker bus\" start=\"112\" end=\"180\"/>  </contributor> </scu> <scu uid=\"9\" label=\"700 injured\">  <contributor label=\"injuring 700\">   <part label=\"injuring 700\" start=\"206\" end=\"218\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"sent 350 to hospitals where 22 remain critical.

        "summary": "  In addition to the current high death toll of 1,121 victims, the severe economic impacts are being assessed. Petroleum and chemicals produced in the Gulf region were sharply reduced as was oil and natural gas extraction. The 0.1% rise was extremely below economic forecasts. Farming losses are expected to be $900 million. Part of the economic impact of Katrina is the unemployment rate in Louisiana which has risen to 11.5%. The U.S. House of Representatives unanimously passed a $6.1 billion tax assistance package for people and businesses displaced due to Katrina and sent it to the U.S. Senate for consideration.    By September 27, 2005 US Katrina deaths reached 1,121. Rescuers searched for victims as successor Hurricane Rita struck. By September 14 Brit Insurance forecast $US 50 billion global insurance losses. Gulf of Mexico oil and natural gas extraction dropped sharply. Refineries and chemical plants faltered. US Agriculture lost $US 900 million. In September Louisiana unemployment was 11.5%, from August's 5.7%. Turkey gave $US 1.5 million to the US Red Cross for Katrina relief and $US 1 million in humanitarian supplies. Bosnia's Red Cross gave money. On September 21, the US House passed $US 6.1 billion in Katrina recovery tax breaks.    The death toll from Hurricane Katrina surpassed 1,100. Turkey has allocated 2.5 million dollars for victims and the Bosnian Red Cross announced that is has started raising money for victims, as well. The US House of Representatives approved tax breaks for victims. The hurricane caused job losses in Louisiana sending its unemployment rate soaring to 11.5 percent. Agricultural losses are expected to reach an estimated 900 million dollars and US industrial output has been depressed by Katrina with severe cut backs in production of petroleum and chemicals.     As of 29 September, Katrina's death toll had reached 1121 including 885 in Louisiana and 200 in Mississippi. The economic impact was massive. The global insurance industry was predicting costs of $40-$50 billion. Agricultural losses were estimated at $900 million. Louisiana's unemployment rate soared to 11.5%. And U.S. industrial output rose only slightly because of cuts in the production of petroleum and chemicals in the Gulf region. 118 countries sent aid, including $2.5 million from Turkey. The U.S. Congress was expected to approve tax breaks of $6.1 billion for people and businesses. </text> <scu uid=\"1\" label=\"Katrina's current death toll is 1,121 victims\">  <contributor label=\"In

        "summary": "  Police arrested Dennis Rader on Feb. 25, 2005 and identified him as the serial killer BTK accused of 10 killings 1974-91. BTK had taunted police with letters to them and the media, but efforts to find him failed and in 1979 the letters ceased. They resumed in March 2004 and the investigation of the BTK case reopened. Forensic experts studied DNA swabs that Kansas Governor Sibelius says linked Rader (BTK) to his victims. Little else has been revealed as to how the perpetrator of these crimes was identified and tracked down.    After two false arrests, suspected Wichita, Kansas &quot;BTK serial killer&quot;, Dennis Rader, was arrested February 25, 2005. He was held for 10 first-degree murders, from 1974 to 1991, but won't get Kansas's death penalty instituted in 1994. Local and county police, the Kansas Bureau of Investigation, and the FBI worked 31 years on 5,000 tips and evidence provided by BTK: eight letters to police and media, a victim's necklace BTK gave to his girl friend, a victim's driver's license, BTK's recorded voice and crime scene semen, thousands of DNA swabs, BTK's DNA linking to Rader, and facts matching Rader's biography.    Wichita police arrested the BTK strangler during a traffic stop on February 25. Dennis Rader, serial killer of at least 10, sent numerous taunting messages and clues in the 1970's before going silent in 1979. In March 2004, he mailed evidence of a previously unattributed 1986 murder to the Wichita Eagle. More letters, clues and evidence followed. Thousands of tips poured in and police received help from forensics experts. Police long believed BTK graduated from Wichita State University, as Rader had. DNA evidence helped solve the case. Police learned of the last two BTK victims upon his arrest.    Wichita police announced the identification and arrest of serial killer BTK (Bind, Torture, Kill). He is Dennis Rader, a 59-year old church leader and government inspector who police believe murdered ten people between 1974 and 1991 and taunted authorities for their inability to catch him. Police received more than 5,000 tips when BTK resurfaced in 2004 after two decades of silence. The Kansas Bureau of Investigation conducted hundreds of DNA swabs in connection with the investigation. Law enforcement officials revealed nothing about the evidence they have against Rader. According to Governor Sebelius DNA evidence linked him to crime scenes. </text> <scu uid=\"2\" label=\"Wichita police announced the identification of serial killer BTK (Bind, Torture, Kill)\">

        "summary": "  Turkey was heavily criticized by international human rights groups over Orhan Pamuk's trial. Turkish intellectuals and EU officials demanded that Turkey change the laws that limit freedom of expression. To avoid an EU confrontation, Turkey's justice minister sent Pamuk's case back to the local Istanbul court, which then dropped the charges on a technicality. The EU welcomed the ruling, which came just days before it was to begin a review of Turkey's justice system. Turkey categorically denies Armenian accusations that up to 1.5 million died in a genocide orchestrated by the Ottoman Empire between 1915 and 1917.      A group of 169 Turkish intellectuals asked the government to scrap laws that limit freedom of expression and interfere with Turkey's democratic process. Istanbul's court dropped charges against Pamuk stating that it wasn't legally competent to judge this case. The court was chided for framing the dismissal in bureaucratic terms rather than addressing freedom of expression. About 70 intellectuals have been charged as well, but they don't have the same high profile as Pamuk. The EU pressed Turkey to address legal loopholes limiting freedom of speech in other cases.    Turkey's Justice Ministry declined to rule on whether Pamuk should be tried, citing recent penal code amendments. It sent the case back to the Istanbul court, which dropped the charges against Pamuk. The case divided Turkey and embarrassed its liberals. Pamuk's remarks also highlighted another painful episode in Turkish history, the 30,000 Kurdish deaths in recent guerrilla fighting in Turkey's Kurdish southeast. Turkish intellectuals, the EU, and most of the West called on Turkey's government to scrap laws limiting freedom of expression. Potential EU partners wanted to know that Turkish laws were the same as laws elsewhere in the EU.    The case against Orhan Pamuk ended on 23 January. The Justice Ministry had refused to issue an approval of the prosecution and told the Istanbul court that it should determine whether to proceed. The Istanbul court dropped the charges. Pamuk's lawyer criticized the decision, saying that it was framed in bureaucratic terms and avoided the issue of freedom of expression. Turkish nationalists were outraged. The EU Enlargement Commissioner said that Pamuk was not the only one facing such charges, he was &quot;just the most high-profile case.&quot; PEN says that some 70 Turkish intellectuals have been charged with similar offenses. </text> <scu uid=\"6\" label=\"The Istanbul court dropped the charges against Pamuk.\">  <contributor label=\"the local Istanbul court, which then dropped the charges on a technicality\">   <part label=\"the local Istanbul court, which then dropped the charges on a technicality\" start=\"346\" end=\"420\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"Istanbul's court dropped charges against Pamuk\">   <part label=\"Istanbul's court dropped charges against Pamuk\" start=\"892\" end=\"938\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"the Istanbul court, which dropped the charges against Pamuk\">   <part label=\"the Istanbul court, which dropped the charges against Pamuk\" start=\"1505\" end=\"1564\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"The Istanbul court dropped the charges\">   <part label=\"The Istanbul court dropped the charges\" start=\"2262\" end=\"2300\"/>  </contributor> </scu> <scu uid=\"3\" label=\"The EU demanded that Turkey change the laws limiting freedom of expression.\">  <contributor label=\"Turkish intellectuals and EU officials demanded that Turkey change the laws that limit freedom of expression\">   <part label=\"Turkish intellectuals and EU officials demanded that Turkey change the laws that limit freedom of expression\" start=\"154\" end=\"262\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"Turkish intellectuals, the EU, and most of the West called on Turkey's government to scrap laws limiting freedom of expression\">   <part label=\"Turkish intellectuals, the EU, and most of the West called on Turkey's government to scrap laws limiting freedom of expression\" start=\"1783\" end=\"1909\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"The EU pressed Turkey to address legal loopholes limiting freedom of speech in other cases\">   <part label=\"The EU pressed Turkey to address legal loopholes limiting freedom of speech in other cases\" start=\"1217\" end=\"1307\"/>  </contributor> </scu> <scu uid=\"5\" label=\"Turkey's Justice Ministry sent Pamuk's case back to the Istanbul court.\">  <contributor label=\"Turkey's justice minister sent Pamuk's case back to the local Istanbul court\">   <part label=\"Turkey's justice minister sent Pamuk's case back to the local Istanbul court\" start=\"294\" end=\"370\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"The Justice Ministry...told the Istanbul court that it should determine whether to proceed\">   <part label=\"The Justice Ministry\" start=\"2116\" end=\"2136\"/>   <part label=\"told the Istanbul court that it should determine whether to proceed\" start=\"2193\" end=\"2260\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"Turkey's Justice Ministry declined to rule on whether Pamuk should be tried, citing recent penal code amendments.

        "summary": "  W. Mark Felt, former Deputy Director of the FBI during the Nixon Administration has ended speculation and admitted to being the mysterious Deep Throat. Felt made his revelation via his lawyer in a Vanity Fair article. The Washington Post was completely blindsided after keeping Felt's secret for 30 years. Reactions to Felt's admission varied from being declared a hero to being called a criminal. Many felt relief at no longer being suspects. Former Nixon aides decried Felt as disloyal and unethical. Bob Woodward is publishing his book on Deep Throat now instead of upon Felt's death as previously planned.    A report in Vanity Fair identifying 1972-73 Watergate leaker &quot;Deep Throat&quot; as the FBI Deputy Director W. Mark Felt, was verified by Felt's grandson on May 31, 2005. Felt is now 91 and in ill health. Editor Bradlee and reporters Woodward and Bernstein of the Washington Post who had kept the secret for over 33 years quickly confirmed the identification. After years of speculation individuals expressed dismay, condemnation, praise and &quot;I told you so!&quot; On June 2 it was announced that Bob Woodward's book on &quot;Deep Throat&quot; would be published in July.    Retired FBI official Mark Felt revealed himself to be the Watergate informant Deep Throat in a Vanity Fair article, ending 33 years of speculation. The revelation surprised everyone, particularly reporters Woodward and Bernstein, who vowed to keep his secret until after his death. Political celebrities, pundits, and minor Watergate figures now claim to have known all along. Felt is being hailed as a hero, denounced as a traitor and accused of partisan politics. A number of other Deep Throat suspects are relieved to be exonerated. Newspapers claim it is an example of how anonymous sources can keep government in check.    Retired FBI official Mark Felt revealed in a Vanity Fair magazine article that he was the source known as Deep Throat, famous during the Watergate scandal. Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein had pledged to keep Deep Throat's identity a secret until his death. After Felt's acknowledgement the two reporters confirmed that the now enfeebled 91-year old Felt was indeed Deep Throat. Felt's announcement ended years of speculation as to Deep Throat's identity and it freed those who were suspected from having to constantly deny that role. Former Nixon associates denounced Felt but others considered him a hero. </text> <scu uid=\"28\" label=\"W. Mark Felt is former Deputy Director of the FBI\">  <contributor label=\"W.

        "summary": "  After Mikhail Saakashvili replaced Eduard Shevardnadze as the Georgian President he vowed to reunite the separatist pro-Russian regions of Georgia and fight against corruption. Adzharia was reunited but not Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Conflicts in these regions include officials screening ship passengers, the threatening of boats in Georgian waters, and the suppression of press critical of Saakashvili. He has the support of the United States in efforts to bring democracy to Georgia without war. Meetings are being held with region leaders mediated by the Russian Foreign Ministry. Saakashvili seeks an agreement between Georgia and Russia to be signed by Putin.    Mikhail Saakashvili won the presidency of Georgia in Jan. 2004 vowing to regain the separatist regions of Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Adzharia. He was successful in restoring Adzharia but has made little headway in the other two. In May he sent troops into South Ossetia culminating in an indecisive temporary cease-fire agreement in August. The same month he threatened ships bound for Abkhazian ports. He offered &quot;the wildest possible autonomy,&quot; but his bid to open talks was rejected by the Abkhazians. By Jan. 2005 he was promising official proposals to the two by the end of the month.    In January 2004, Saakashvili regained control of Adzharia. Georgia searched ships arriving in Abkhazia. Saakashvili offered &quot;widest possible autonomy&quot; to Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Georgian troops entered South Ossetia despite threats of Russian intervention. Georgian coast guards fired on a Turkish ship near Abkhazia. Georgia threatened withdrawal from the Commonwealth of Independent States. Georgia and South Ossetia agreed to mutual withdrawal of troops. Georgia said it would not start a war and denied stationing 700 troops on the Abkhazia border. Saakashvilli was to make official proposals to Abkhazia and South Ossetia and finalize a framework agreement on relations with Russia.      Saakashvili's priority is to reunite pro-Russian separatist regions with Georgia. He succeeded in Adzharia, but not in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Saakashvili has sent troops to the regions during times of heightened tensions and engaged in on-again off-again negotiations with the self-proclaimed governments. He ordered Georgian authorities to screen ships arriving in Abkhazia, threatened to sink Russian tour boats, and had coast guards fire on a Turkish ship. He closed down South Ossetia's trade in smuggled Russian goods. Saakashvili is seeking better relations with Moscow to improve relations with the renegade regions, and will soon present official proposals to them. </text> <scu uid=\"21\" label=\"Mikhail

On Sept. 21 the IOC Athletes Commission and the Summer Olympic sports demanded suspension of the French laboratory that accused Armstrong, claiming that its tests were illegal. The charge was made in a letter to the World Anti-Doping Agency President, who replied that the laboratory did not appear to have broken any ethical rules. On Oct. 6 the UCI President called for an independent investigator to look into the Armstrong matter in case ongoing investigations by UCI and WADA reached different conclusions.    Armstrong sued SCA Promotions for breach of contract based on L'Equip's charges. ICU's Verbruggen refuted WADA's Pound's claims Verbruggen gave L'Equip information linking Armstrong to positive 1999 erythropoietin results. Verbruggen claimed Pound blocked ICU's investigation and made &quot;transparently erroneous statements&quot;. The International Olympic Athletes Commission and Summer Olympic Sports both demanded WADA's lab be suspended for illegally violating WADA code. The IOC and the ICU each appointed independent investigators into all issues relating to the Tour's 1999 positive tests.    Lance Armstrong continues to vehemently deny doping charges. The IOC president called for an independent investigation into allegations he used EPO in 1999. He questioned the integrity and validity of the tests and demanded the laboratory be suspended. The International Cycling Union and the World Anti-Doping Agency both announced separate inquiries. UCI and WADA have been feuding over the case. UCI accused WADA of withholding information. WADA accused former UCI president Verbruggen of leaking documents to L'Equipe.    The International Cycling Union (ICU) gave Lance Armstrong major support in his fight against doping allegations. An ICU statement said no action would be taken against Armstrong over claims that his 1999 urine samples tested positive for EPO. The ICU found no wrongdoing and no reason to condemn him. The IOC Athletes Commission and the Summer Olympic sports (ASOIF) have demanded the French lab that tested Armstrong's urine be suspended. The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) insists the lab broke a host of rules set down by the WADA Code. </text> <scu uid=\"46\" label=\"International Cycling Union (UCI) investigating allegations of

        "summary": "  The FARC, Colombia's largest leftist guerrilla force, commits selective murders, slaughters and other terrorist acts. In 2003, FARC commandos attacked two Bogota pubs, targeting US citizens who frequented them. FARC kidnaps hundreds of people a year for ransom and holds dozens as exchangeables, including Colombian politicians, police officers, soldiers and currently three US citizens. Colombia's government is willing to negotiate a prisoner swap with FARC to free rebel hostages, including the three Americans. The move is encouraged by the UN. So far FARC has not agreed to the government's terms. FARC has ordered its troops to kill Colombia's president.    The Columbian Navy captured a member of the rebel group, Revolutionary Armed Forces of Columbia (FARC), who was believed to be involved in slaughtering five members of the same family. US warned US citizens in Columbia of a possible spike in &quot;terrorist activity.&quot; FARC, with about 17,000 fighters and a smaller leftist guerilla group are locked in a 40-year civil war with the government. FARC allegedly finances itself through drug trafficking and kidnappings. About 3,500 people are killed yearly. Columbia's president is ready to negotiate a prisoner swap with FARC.      The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Columbia (FARC), the largest and oldest guerilla organization in Columbia, allegedly finances itself through drug trafficking and kidnappings. FARC, which may have 20,000 combatants, is accused of committing murders and slaughters as well as terrorist acts in different part of Columbia. FARC kidnaps hundreds each year for ransom and holds dozens of &quot;exchangeables&quot; including politicians, police, soldiers, and three US contractors. Columbia's President Alvaro Uribe has appealed for international support in his country's war against the rebel groups. Uribe has indicated a readiness to negotiate a prisoner swap with FARC.    Colombian President Pastrana held talks with FARC and designated a safe haven until FARC hijacked an airliner and kidnapped a senator. In 2003 FARC bombed American-frequented pubs and abducted three Americans after a plane crash. In 2004 FARC killed five members of a Colombian family and bombed a peasant home, killing one. The US designated FARC a terrorist organization and aided Colombia financially in its anti-FARC war. President Uribe offered to swap 50 jailed rebels for 50 hostages. FARC-government fighting kills 3,500 yearly. A FARC bomb narrowly missed Uribe in 2002. Uribe is pursuing an aggressive military offensive against FARC.  </text> <scu uid=\"1\" label=\"The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Columbia (FARC), is the largest guerilla organization in Columbia\">

        "summary": "  Criticism by Russian authorities of their Navy arose quickly following the rescue. Accident notification was delayed as in the Kursk tragedy. Putin ordered an investigation. Russian rescuers damaged their underwater robotic vehicle during the rescue attempt making it inoperable. When the British rescue vehicle arrived by air there was no equipment to unload it. Russia is considering purchasing a robotic Scorpio or Panther for underwater rescue operations. Adm. Kuroyedov, head of the Russian Navy, was fired and replaced by Adm. Masorin. Masorin has been charged with improving the Navy. Operation errors by the crew were cited as causing the accident.    Following recovery of the submarine, Russian authorities praised the international rescue effort and thanked Britain, the U.S. and Japan, but questions were soon raised as to why their navy did not have the proper equipment for such an operation. Updated equipment was soon purchased. President Putin ordered an investigation of the accident. On Sept. 4 Putin fired the head of the navy. On Sept 6 the defense minister announced that the submarine accident was a result of outrageous violations of the instructions by senior officials of the Russian Pacific Fleet and that the crew had made errors.    An investigation uncovered violations of instructions and errors in operating the mini-sub that contributed to the recent accident. Prosecutors accused a naval officer of negligence for damaging Russia's own Venom rescue vehicle, thereby necessitating international assistance. Newspapers criticized the navy for waiting over a day before revealing information about the accident. There are conflicting reports about whether the sub was caught in cables or fishing nets. The Russian navy is considering buying at least one Scorpio and possibly a newer model Panther rescue vehicle. The head of the Russian navy was fired, probably in part because of the accident.    Putin ordered the Defense Minister to launch an investigation. The head of the Navy was fired. A Navy captain was accused of damaging a Russian under-water remote-controlled vehicle in rescue attempts. Five British, one Japanese, and two Americans were given state awards. The seven crew members were given awards for bravery, but later accused of violating operating procedures and causing the sub's entanglement. The Russian navy was considering buying one or two submersible rescue vessels. The rescue cost Russia an estimated $1.5 million. Britain, the U.S., and Japan did not charge Russia for their assistance. </text> <scu uid=\"56\" label=\"Putin ordered an investigation\">  <contributor label=\"Putin ordered an investigation\">

        "summary": "  In August 2003, former Liberian President, Charles Taylor, accepted asylum in Nigeria from 17 counts of war crimes in Sierra Leone. He has been accused of violating the asylum agreement by harboring Al-Qaeda terrorists, interfering with Liberian presidential elections and an assassination attempt on the Guinea President. The U.N.-backed Special Court for Sierra Leone is pressuring the Nigerian to send Taylor home to Liberia. U.N. peacekeepers would transfer him to Sierra Leone for prosecution. Reversing an earlier statement, Liberia's new President states that Taylor should go directly to Sierra Leone from Nigeria since he has not been indicted in Liberia.    Charles Taylor fled Liberia in August 2003 accepting an invitation from Nigeria for exile. He lived in a luxury villa near the town of Calibar near the border with Cameroon. He was accused of continuing to meddle in Liberian politics, of funding and planning the assassination of the President of Guinea and of backing Sierra Leone rebels. He was also said to give support to Al-Qaeda in its efforts to destabilize West Africa. In March 2006, Nigeria offered to return Taylor to Liberia for trial, but Liberia didn't want him so he remained in his luxury villa.    After Taylor fled Liberia, he took comfortable asylum in Nigeria, agreeing not to interfere in Liberia or other countries. Nigeria would return him to Liberia, only if a newly elected Liberia government formally requested it, but not directly to an international war crimes court in Sierra Leone. From Nigeria, Taylor meddled in Liberia's elections and implicated Al-Qaida and blood diamonds in his attempted assassination of Guinea's president, so he could move to Guinea. In March 2006 the new Liberian president requested Taylor be released to Sierra Leone vice Liberia. President Bush and Obasanjo were to discuss Taylor on March 29.    Former Liberian President Charles Taylor fled to Nigeria in August 2003 and is under house arrest at a riverside villa in Calabar. Taylor regularly defies restrictions against travel, political activity or media contact. He is actively trying to destabilize West Africa, spending money he looted from Liberia. Taylor meddles in Liberian affairs, harbors members of Al-Qaeda, and ordered an assassination attempt against Guinea's President Conte. Nigerian President Obasanjo agreed to turn Taylor over to Liberia but is pressured to send him to war crimes court in Sierra Leone where Taylor is under indictment for crimes against humanity while backing rebels. </text> <scu uid=\"79\" label=\"Former President Charles Taylor fled Liberia in August 2003\">  <contributor label=\"Former Liberian President Charles Taylor fled to Nigeria in August

        "summary": "  On Sept. 22, 2004 the Office of Federal Enterprise Oversight cited numerous accounting irregularities in mortgage giant Fannie Mae (Fannie) headed by Franklin Raines. It was charged that earnings were doctored to inflate executive compensation. Raines could possibly face not only loss of his position, but fines and prison for falsifying financial statements. On Dec. 15 the Securities and Exchange Commission concluded that Fannie had indeed violated accounting rules. Lawmakers called for return of millions in executive bonuses. Raines received $14 million in salary and $25 million in incentive pay 2001-2003. Raines defended Fannie's accounting.    As late as December 21, 2004, Franklin Raines was said to be still under criminal investigation by the Justice Department for alleged financial accounting manipulations at Fannie Mae. It is not clear if Raines himself was ever under criminal investigation related to criminal charges against Time Warner and AOL, which the two companies together paid over $500 million to settle in December 2004. Those charges stemmed from alleged fraudulent accounting practices dating back to when AOL was a separate company and Director Raines was a member of AOL's audit committee.    Franklin Raines, the chairman and chief executive of Fannie Mae is defending its accounting practices and disagrees with allegations that it violated rules to maximize executive bonuses. Fannie Mae will be investigated by the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and faces litigation by shareholders. Raines and other executives could not only lose their jobs, but also face fines and prison for knowingly certifying false financial statements. They can be compelled to give back incentive pay and gains from sale of stock.    Major concerns have arisen over the leadership and credibility of Fannie Mae's CEO Franklin Raines. The regulatory agency known as OFHEO conducted the Initial investigations into Fannie Mae's accounting practices and found that the company had violated accounting rules to present a picture of financial well-being and to maximize executive bonuses. Raines has had to testify before the House Financial Services Committee. The Justice Department is conducting an investigation. The SEC has opened an inquiry into company accounting practices. The U.S. attorney's office is pursuing a criminal investigation. And eight lawsuits have been filed on behalf of shareholders. </text> <scu uid=\"31\" label=\"There are allegations of accounting irregularities at Fannie Mae\">  <contributor label=\"On Sept. 22,

Over 20 insects plague northwest China's arrow bamboo, a major food source for giant Pandas. The U.S. National Zoo's research advances in giant panda reproductive cycles and artificial insemination will increase endangered giant panda populations in captivity and in the wild. India is building two commercially viable, environmentally friendly, one-megawatt, &quot;green power&quot; bamboo gasification-based electricity plants. A wide variety of bamboo fiber rugs are available, including kiln-dried and carbonized bamboo with polyurethane coatings.    Nigeria is using bamboo to revitalize its agriculture. It has set up a database exploring its abundant bamboo resource to produce byproducts. A state in northeast India plans to set up power stations that run on bamboo to help meet the regions energy needs. A Chinese company has successfully produced fiber from maize and blended it with bamboo fiber to make environment-friendly clothes. Forestry experts in northwest China have identified more than 20 insects, which are causing arrow bamboo to wither and die causing shortages of food for pandas. Help for pandas is being arranged.    China earned as much as $3.5B in foreign exchange from the bamboo-based sector in 2003. Nigeria hopes to follow that example and effectively explore its abundant bamboo resources that can turn out about 300 byproducts. India, second to China in bamboo production, is set to pioneer environmentally friendly power stations that run on bamboo. New products from bamboo include non-slip rugs, fiber for clothing and pre-fabricated quake-shelters. Bamboo's 60-year blooming and seeding cycle and the identification of more than 20 insects that plague arrow bamboo threaten the staple of the pandas' diet.     Retailers offer bamboo-extract towels and bamboo rugs. A Chinese company introduced bamboo fiber in 2004. A bamboo-maize blend makes soft, comfortable, wrinkle-resistant clothing. Bamboo earned China $3.5 billion in 2003. Nigeria is partnering with China to develop its vast bamboo reserve. India is pioneering a power station to turn bamboo into gas then electricity and run local paper mills. Arrow bamboo, plagued by over 20 insects, is low in nutrition but giant pandas' main food. Logging and development threaten bamboo forests. Starving people in Malawi resorted to eating bamboo seeds. Bamboo shoots contaminated with botulism sickened 163 in Thailand. </text> <scu uid=\"36\" label=\"Arrow bamboo is giant pandas' main food\">  <contributor label=\"Arrow bamboo...giant pandas' main

        "summary": "  The Ukrainian presidential election race to replace President Kuchma is close and competitive. Viktor Yushchenko, former Prime Minister and leader of the anti-Kuchma opposition has a small lead over Viktor Yanukovich, current Prime Minister and Kuchma supporter. Yushchenko became dangerously ill during the campaign claiming an assassination attempt. No evidence of poisoning has been found by Ukrainian or U.S. investigations. Yushchenko won the first vote but Yanukovich was declared President after a disputed runoff vote. Yushchenko demanded the results be annulled. Yanukovich offered Yushchenko the prime ministry but Yushchenko refused and called for both candidates to withdraw from the race.    In Ukraine's 2004 presidential campaign, pro-western candidate Yushchenko claimed he was poisoned by supporters of pro-Russian candidate, current Prime Minister Yanukovich. International observers alleged election violations. Yanukovich moved the Kiev Liberation Day military parade to October 29, raising fears of a military crackdown or canceled elections. State media denied Yushchenko any coverage. Students and public employees were pressured to vote for Yanukovich. Yanukovich raised pensions before the elections. On October 31, Yushchenko got 39.82%, Yanukovich 39.32%. An emergency Parliament meeting without a quorum reversed Yanukovich's November 21 victory. A healthier Yushchenko proposed new elections. Yanukovich offered Yushchenko the Prime Ministry.    Ukraine's October 31 presidential elections reduced the candidates from 24 to two, pro-Moscow Viktor Yanukovich and pro-west Viktor Yushchenko. The November 21 runoff election results are being disputed. Yushchenko is claiming Yanukovich's victory is the result of an illegal electoral commission decision and is demanding they be annulled. While campaigning, Yushchenko was struck by a mysterious illness in September and spent most of the month in an Austrian hospital. He and his supporters believe he was poisoned by political rivals. Doctors are still examining blood and other samples to determine the cause. They expect him to make a full recovery.    Ukrainian presidential elections were extremely close between the two leading candidates, pro-West Yushchenko and pro-Russia Yanukovich. Runoff elections on 21 November resulted in a standoff, with Yushchenko refusing to recognize Yanukovich as President and calling for new elections, and with Yanukovich saying that he would appoint Yushchenko Prime Minister. In September Yushchenko was treated in Vienna for a mysterious illness which paralyzed and scarred part of his face. Supporters claimed that the illness, which occurred after a meeting with the former head of the KGB, was an assassination attempt. Doctors said that they did not know the cause. </text> <scu uid=\"1\" label=\"Ukrainian presidential election race close and competitive\">  <contributor label=\"Ukrainian presidential election race

        "summary": "  China sacrificed coal mine safety in its massive demand for energy. Gas explosions, flooding, fires, and cave-ins cause most accidents. The mining industry is riddled with corruption from mining officials to owners. Officials are often illegally invested in mines and ignore safety procedures for production. South Africa recently provided China with information on mining safety and technology during a conference. China is beginning enforcement of safety regulations. Over 12,000 mines have been ordered to suspend operations and 4,000 others ordered closed. This year 4,228 miners were killed in 2,337 coal mine accidents. China's mines are the most dangerous worldwide.    Chinese coalmines are said to be the most dangerous in the world.  January-September 2005 there were 2337 coal-mine accidents killing 4228 people, up 8.5 percent from the rate in 2004.  Accidents included explosions, floods and cave-ins.  The Chinese government has issued mine-safety regulations, but enforcement is ineffective.  Mines are shut down for violation of regulations, but the demand for coal is great and many mines owned by local officials quickly reopen without sanction.  In August 2005 the government ordered all officials with coalmine investments to withdraw their stakes.    China's accident-plagued coal mines cause thousands of deaths and injuries annually. 2004 saw over 6,000 mine deaths. January through August 2005, deaths rose 8.5% over the same period in 2004. Most accidents are gas explosions, but fires, floods, and cave-ins also occur. Ignored safety procedures, outdated equipment, and corrupted officials exacerbate the problem. Official responses include shutting down thousands of ill-managed and illegally-run mines, punishing errant owners, issuing new safety regulations and measures, and outlawing local officials from investing in mines. China also sought solutions at the Conference on South African Coal Mining Safety Technology and Equipment held in Beijing.    China will close 8,648 coal mines during October 2005, for renewal of safety certificates in view of the large number of mine accidents causing loss of life. During the first nine months of the year, there were 2337 accidents killing 4228 miners. Mine safety procedures have been ignored in the quest for profits, especially by those mines owned or partly-owned by local officials. A total of 4,578 officials admitted to having stakes in coal mines. China is seeking solutions from the world, especially South Africa, to improve mining safety. By November, 12,148 mines were ordered shut down for recertification. </text> <scu uid=\"144\" label=\"Mine safety sacrificed for energy\">  <contributor label=\"China sacrificed coal mine safety in

        "summary": "  Cell-phone driving laws are having limited success in passage. Federal bills died in committee. Without a national consensus, existing state and local government laws vary widely. Drivers either ignore or are unaware of existing laws. Enforcement is not uniform. Lobbyists oppose legislation and argue driver distraction by various factors is at fault not cell-phone technology. A survey of cell phone records and accidents in Australia conducted by the U.S. based Insurance Institute for Highway Safety concludes that there is little difference between hand-held and hands-free device driver distraction. The survey confirms that cell-phone use while driving increases injuries and deaths.    The District of Columbia, New York and New Jersey passed legislation that bans using hand-held cell phones while driving. More than 400,000 tickets and warnings have been issued since New York first enacted this law. New Mexico and Chicago City only allow hands-free cell phone. Texas is considering cell phone laws. An Insurance Institute of Highway Safety survey said using any cell phones while driving is dangerous. Drivers using cell phones are four times as likely to end up in a crash as drivers who didn't use a cell phone.    Forty-five countries banned hand-held phone use while driving. In the US only New York, New Jersey and the District of Columbia completely ban hand-held phone use. Some states direct hand-held bans to specific groups such as school bus drivers or those on learner's permits. Some municipalities have enacted bans but some have been overturned by states declining to take action against cell phone use. Some jurisdictions permit hands-free cell phone use. Cell phone bills in Texas and California failed to carry. Laws are often ignored and enforcement spotty. However, Washington police average 600 tickets and 250 warnings each month.    The District of Columbia, NY state, New Jersey, Connecticut and Chicago ban the use of hand-held cell phones while driving. Some states or cities ban use with learner's permits, by school bus drivers, by minors for six months after getting their licenses, or require hands-free phones. Every state has considered restrictions but bills seldom pass. Some states, including Florida, prohibit local governments from restricting cell phone use. Hands-free and hand-held cell phones are equally distracting. Laws are often ignored. Enforcement is spotty. Hand-held phone use while driving is banned in 45 countries, including Australia, Germany, France, Britain and Japan. </text> <scu uid=\"1\" label=\"Certain US places ban the use of hand-held cell

        "summary": "  On Thanksgiving Day Stewart was able to enjoy a visit from her family, a privilege normally limited to weekends. By Christmas she was calling for sentencing reform particularly for drug and first-time offenders. By mid-January Stewart had tried her hand at ceramics and crocheting. As she completed her term in March she was 20 pounds lighter, having taught yoga and foraged for greens on prison grounds as well as abhorring the food. After leaving Alderson at 12:30 a.m. on March 3, 2005, Martha Steward declared the 5-month experience as &quot;life altering and life affirming.&quot;    Martha Stewart spent Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's in prison. Her job there was cleaning. During her stay, she did ceramics, crocheted, taught yoga, decorated the chapel for a memorial service, became an expert on vending-machine snacks, and foraged the grounds for fresh greens for the prison salads. She was grateful for the support of her friends, family, colleagues, and fans. Stewart became a prison reform advocate through her experience. She emerged from the Alderson prison on March 4 with head held high, 20 pounds lighter and a lot wealthier, since shares in her company nearly tripled in value.    In a Christmas message posted on her personal web site, Martha Stewart called for sentencing reform. She suggested pushing for reforms in federal sentencing guidelines for nonviolent first-time offenders and particularly for drug offenders, who would be better served in rehabilitation than prison. She is scheduled to be released in early March 2004 and then must spend five months under house arrest. Her company announced that Stewart would host a daytime talk show after her sentence. Since her conviction, her company's share price has nearly tripled increasing her personal stake.    At Alderson Martha had time to think, became a more sympathetic character, and got wealthier as her company's share price tripled. Her family visited at Thanksgiving. Martha's prison job was cleaning, sweeping, vacuuming and raking leaves. Via her website Martha received 15,000 fan e-mails, and said she was safe, fit and healthy but found the loss of freedom and privacy difficult. Fellow inmates shielded her from paparazzi. She picked wild greens to augment the bad food, lost 20 pounds, learned to crochet, taught yoga, tried ceramics, decorated the chapel, ordered seeds for her garden at home, and made to-do lists.

An unprecedented court injunction was issued to prevent those purchasers from reading, copying, selling, or talking about the book prior to the launch. In the first 24 hours available, the book sold 6.9 copies in the US. The second printing is being delivered to US bookstores. A Braille edition will be available within 3 days of the initial launch so the sight impaired will not have to wait. The Potter books have been translated into 63 languages with more than 300 million copies sold.    Special events were planned at bookstores worldwide, including Asia, for the much-anticipated release of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. The author herself was to host a special celebration at Edinburgh Castle for 70 children from around the world. A US drug store accidentally sold one copy of the book ahead of the release date. The customer agreed to return the book. The book shattered publishing records in the United States. A Braille edition of the latest Harry Potter book is was released on July 19. In October, French, Portuguese and Chinese editions of the book were released.

        "summary": "  Open season for Medicare Part D has begun. States and local communities are offering resources in addition to the federal ones to assist enrollees due to the plan's complexities. Medicare is staffing phones round the clock everyday. The Medicare website has been so inundated with traffic that it is extremely slow or jammed thus adding to the frustration and anger of enrollees seeking information independently. Due to the extensive criticism of the plan, some lawmakers are seeking a two-year delay in its implementation. Computer savvy children of seniors are just as confused and baffled over plan details as their parents.    Calls for help have increased sharply since enrollment for Medicare Part D opened. Many organizations and volunteers try to supplement the swamped Medicare lines, but all face developing backlogs and problems training personnel. The multiplicity of options, deductibles, premiums and exceptions make comparisons overwhelming if not impossible. Some lawmakers are suggesting a two-year delay in implementation of the plan. One week into open application, The New York Times declared Part D as an attempt to do something about drug costs for seniors and at the same time protect drug and insurance companies. &quot;It's a mess. It's hopelessly confusing.&quot;    Seniors are daunted by comparing their current coverage with Part D, baffled by hundreds of complex options, and fearful of picking the wrong Part D plan with wide-ranging premiums and unpredictable coverage changes, potentially costing them several thousands of dollars more annually. Only 6% of Medicare beneficiaries visited the balky web-based Part D plan selection tool. Many drug companies will stop offering free or subsidized promotional drugs to needy seniors. Increased competition among Part D private providers lowered some premiums, but a Senate report showed Part D drug prices are 3% higher than CostCo and Drugstore.com; 60% higher than Canada.    The Plan D's intricacies and implementation have been so criticized that some lawmakers a pushing for a two-year delay. Various consumer advocacy groups will assist Medicare enrollees in understanding Plan D. A Medicare spokesman said that the agency updated the plans and prices every Monday and that an enrollee could change plans every day until the end of 2005. When the program starts on January 1st, the enrollee will be paying the rate quoted at enrollment time. Plan D got off to a rocky start with the beginning of enrollment on November 15, because of the complexity of the system. </text> <scu uid=\"1\" label=\"Open season for Medicare Part D has begun\">

        "summary": "  North Korea withdrew from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and is in a standoff with six other nations. North Korea's position is that nuclear weapons are needed for their defense. The negotiations with South Korea, Japan, China, Russia, the UK and the US to persuade North Korea to cease its nuclear weapons programs are continuing without much progress. North Korea demands to be treated as a nuclear power and for disarmament talks to apply to all countries involved. South Korea has proposed that the international community aid North Korea economically and institute a rehabilitation program once the nuclear issue is resolved.    In February 2005 North Korea declared it manufactured nuclear weapons and won't rejoin six-nation talks (North Korea, South Korea, China, Russia, Japan, U.S.). In May the IAEA reported N.K. had close to six nuclear weapons. N.K. and S.K. resumed direct talks. In July N.K. returned to six-nation talks after the U.S. recognized N.K.'s sovereignty. S.K. offered N.K. food, electricity, APEC membership, a multinational rehabilitation fund, and to establish a Northeast Asian Development Bank, if N.K. abandons nuclear weapons, which the U.S. called &quot;premature&quot;. N.K. said it would return to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, after its nuclear weapons program was resolved.     North Korea withdrew from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty after the United States accused the country of having a nuclear weapons program based on enriched uranium. North Korea declared in February 2005 that it has already built nuclear bombs. Since 2003, the six-nation (United States, North Korea, South Korea, China, Japan and Russia) talks have aimed at persuading North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons in exchange for diplomatic and economic benefits and security guarantees.    Several rounds of six-party tallks on North Korea's nuclear program have broken down since August 2003 without an agreement. South Korea, the U.S., Japan, China, and Russia want North Korea to abandon its development of nuclear weapons. Pyongyang insists on having nuclear power for peaceful purposes, something opposed by the U.S. South Korea has promised massive aid to North Korea, including electricity, rice, and other necessities, if an agreement can be reached within the six-party framework. It has also suggested a rehabilitation program for the North, a proposal that the U.S. and Japan strongly oppose. </text> <scu uid=\"16\" label=\"North Korea is in talks with six nations\">

        "summary": "  Three pipeline projects underway to transport natural gas from Asia to Europe are raising political and unspecified environmental concerns. A northern pipeline delivers gas to Germany, France and England. A central one connects Turkey to Romania, Bulgaria and Austria. The southern one supplies Greece and Italy from Turkey. The pipeline to Germany circumvents the concept of a common European policy with Russia. Russia has a monopoly agreement on gas exported from Kazakhstan produced in Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Russia's actions are viewed as applying political pressure on neighboring countries. The pipelines are expected to begin operating between 2007 and 2010.    Gazprom, the state-controlled Russian gas group and the German company BASF plan a Baltic Sea pipeline to transport Russian gas directly to Europe. The pipeline will be launched in 2010, three years from the original estimate. It will make landfall in northern Germany then continue to the Netherlands and across the English Channel. Austria and Bulgaria plan a gas pipeline from Turkey through Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary to Austria. Construction is to begin on a Turkey-Greece pipeline to transport Caspian and Central Asian natural gas to Europe. An underwater pipeline from Greece to Italy is part of the plan.    Russia's Gazprom will control the Northern European Gas Pipeline, bringing Siberian gas directly to Europe. It will bypass Poland, Ukraine and Belarus, who fear being cut off from Russian gas. Gazprom and Germany's BASF will build it. Gerhard Schroeder, criticized for profiting from a project he supported while German chancellor, will chair the board. Gazprom arranged a monopoly on gas from Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan through Kazakhstan. The Austria-Bulgaria &quot;Nabucco&quot; project is a gas pipeline from Turkey to Austria. A Southern Europe Gas Ring from Turkey through Greece and across the Ionian Sea to Italy is to be completed by 2006.    The Northern European Gas Pipeline, which will bring gas from Northern Siberia through Russia and under the Baltic Sea to northern Germany, then to the Netherlands and under the English Channel to Britain. Poland, the Baltic states, Belarus, and Ukraine are critical of the pipeline, because it bypasses current transit routes through those countries. The Southern Europe Gas Ring project is to transport natural gas from the Caspian Sea area and Central Asia through Turkey and Greece then under the Ionian Sea to Italy. Construction of the Turkey-Greece segment is scheduled to start in July 2005. </text> <scu uid=\"1\" label=\"The Northern European Gas Pipeline (NEGP) will bring Russian gas from Siberia\">

        "summary": "  President Bush's nomination of Harriet Miers for the Supreme Court caused much consternation. The White House counsel was endorsed by the Democratic Senate leader while the Republican conservative base was splintered. Moderate Republicans sided with their president while most Democrats and liberal advocacy groups stayed out of the fray. On Oct. 12, 2005 Bush tried to promote confirmation by vouching for Miers as an evangelical Christian, but conservatives said the issue was not religion but her lack of qualifications. On Oct. 21 the Senate Judiciary Committee found Miers' answers to a committee questionnaire &quot;inadequate,&quot; &quot;insufficient,&quot; and &quot;insulting.&quot;    President Bush nominated his longtime lawyer and friend Harriet Miers for the U.S. Supreme Court to replace retiring Justice Sandra Day O'Conner. Miers, currently White House counsel, would join Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg as the second woman on the court. Conservatives urged Mr. Bush to withdraw her nomination saying that she lacks the qualifications having never been a judge and has little experience in constitutional law. They further state that her nomination looks like cronyism. There is also concern that her religious belief may influence her decisions as a Justice.     President Bush nominated his longtime lawyer and friend Harriet Miers for the US Supreme Court. The announcement initially drew kind words from some Democrats but skepticism from some conservatives. Some Bush critics charged cronyism in the selection. Miers has few credentials of any kind to carry her into confirmation hearings and little experience in constitutional law. The Judiciary Committee called her response to a questionnaire inadequate, insufficient and insulting. Bush stated that part of Miers life is her religion and that appeared to further inflame the controversy. Conservatives continued to deride Miers' nomination and called for its withdrawal.    President Bush has nominated White House Counsel Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court. The nomination must be confirmed by the U.S. Senate. There is increasingly strong opposition to the nomination, with outrage expressed by conservatives such as Pat Buchanan and Charles Krauthammer. The major objections are that she has few credentials or qualifications and that the nomination looks like cronyism. Bush cited religion as one criterion for her selection. She is scheduled to face the Senate Judiciary Committee in November. The committee sent her a questionaire, but found her responses &quot;inadequate&quot; and &quot;insulting&quot; and asked her to redo it. </text> <scu uid=\"53\" label=\"President Bush nominated

In August 2004 five churches in Baghdad and Mosul were blown up and in the following two months it is estimated that 15,000 Christians left for Syria and Jordan. Many of the emigrants blamed the attacks not on Muslim Iraqis but on foreigners. By January 2005 the Christian minority was organized into political parties in preparation for the January 30th parliamentary elections. On January 15th gunmen kidnapped the Syrian Archbishop of Mosul, an act interpreted as warning Christians not to vote in the forthcoming elections.    Iraqi Christians who are increasingly targeted by insurgents are leaving Baghdad for the Kurdish north, Syria and Jordan. The move is temporary because they aren't selling their homes and property. About 15,000 of Iraqi nearly 1 million Christians have left the country since August 2004. Insurgents abducted a Syrian Catholic Archbishop apparently to frighten Iraqi Christians in upcoming elections. Former Archbishop of Canterbury launched a campaign to assure the future of Iraqi Christian community. Their rights should be enshrined in the new Iraqi constitution and financial aid given for return to their lands and homes.    Assyrian Christians in Iraq date to the pre-Islamic first century. Modern day Christians have represented three percent of Iraq's population. Muslims regularly persecuted Christians, intent on driving them out. Iraqi Christians' future looked brighter after Saddam's fall but now looks worse, even though freedom of religion was stipulated in the interim constitution. Since the war began, over 100 Christians have been killed. Militants target Christians and try to shut their worldly business and keep them from voting. Fifteen thousand Christians have left Iraq. Twelve churches were bombed. The Chaldean patriarch's home was attacked and Mosul's Archbishop Casmoussa was kidnapped.    Christians make up about three percent of Iraq's population. Since the U.S.-led war started, armed attacks have led many to leave the country, mostly for neighboring Syria and Jordan. Several churches in Baghdad and Mosul have been attacked and more than 100 Christians have been killed, with many more wounded. Those targeted have included people helping the U.S.-led forces, as well as those in occupations seen as breaking Islamic law, such as owners of liquor-stores and beauty parlors. In mid-January, just before the upcoming elections, a Catholic archbishop was kidnapped by gunmen in Mosul. </text> <scu uid=\"2\" label=\"Christians constitute about three percent of Iraq's

A third, hopeful round of AU-lead peace talks began in Abuja on December 11, 2004, seeking a political settlement. SLA and JEM pulled out of the peace talks on December 13, which were suspended until January, even as rebels vowed never to return until Sudan stopped attacking. December 14-17 in Ndjamena, Darfur's National Movement for Reconstruction and Development signed a separate Chad-mediated peace pact with Sudan.     Peace talks on the crisis in Sudan's Darfur region restart. But rebel leaders pulled out of the talks accusing the government of repeatedly breaching a ceasefire agreement. The African Union is trying to put peace negotiations back on track. The rebels vowed never to resume the negotiation process unless the government ends its attacks and withdraws from the troubled area. Peace talks between the Sudanese government and the rebel groups have been suspended until January 2005.    The Sudanese government and the People's Liberation Movement promised to conclude two years of talks, now in Naivasha, with a peace accord. Separate talks with two Darfur rebel groups which stopped on November 24, are to resume on December 10. This third round of Peace Talks scheduled for Abuja were halted when rebel leaders pulled out. The African Union announced that the talks have been suspended until January 2005. A third rebel group signed a peace pact with the Khartoum government at talks in Chad.    The third round of AU-sponsored talks, which started in Abuja on 10 December after a one-day delay for logistical problems, were suspended on 12 December when the rebels walked out. The two sides traded accusations of ceasefire violations. The talks are expected to resume in January despite statements by the AU mediator that the talks had not been suspended but would resume the following day. A third rebel group signed a peace pact with the Khartoum governmenton 17 December at talks in Chad. </text> <scu uid=\"2\" label=\"Abuja peace talks held a second round [Abuja 2]\">  <contributor

        "summary": "  The U.S. Senate remains deadlocked in confirmation proceedings for Justice Janice Rogers Brown for the U.S. Appeals Court in the District of Columbia. Democrats are threatening filibusters to block her confirmation because her judicial views are considered extreme. The Senate Judiciary Committee engaged in angry debates. Republicans are threatening the 'nuclear option' as a means to end any filibusters. Republicans dismissed a Democratic proposal because it did not include the removal of filibusters. Additional compromise talks ended unsuccessfully. A new proposed agreement would allow Democrats to filibuster only in extreme circumstances. A new confirmation vote date has not been determined.    On April 21, 2005 the Senate Judiciary Committee voted to revive the long dormant nomination of Janice Rogers Brown of the California Supreme Court to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia. Brown's nomination had been blocked by Democratic filibuster during President Bush's first term. Senate leaders began negotiations over various compromise proposals on handling judicial nominations with the Republican leaders threatening to rule out the filibuster. By May 17 it appeared that Brown's nomination would not reach the Senate floor for another week or perhaps not until after Memorial Day.    In April 2005, the Judiciary Committee approved and sent for U.S. Senate confirmation, the nomination of Janice Rogers Brown to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia. Democratic Senate Minority Leader Reid promised to filibuster against her. Republican Senate Majority leader Frist threatened a parliamentary maneuver to change Senate rules to permanently eliminate filibusters in judicial confirmations, including Supreme Court nominees. Six Republican Senators and six Democratic Senators considered a pact to vote to prevent judicial filibusters, except in &quot;extreme circumstances&quot;, and defeat filibuster rule changes. The vote on Brown's confirmation was expected in late May.    The long-dormant and controversial appeals court nomination of Janice Rogers Brown will soon go before the Senate. Republicans plan to use a parliamentary maneuver called the nuclear option that would effectively outlaw filibusters. Moderate Democratic and Republican senators have been trying to work out a compromise that would enable confirmation votes to move forward without such a rule change, so far unsuccessfully. Democrats oppose her nomination, claiming she would advance extremist conservative views, particularly on issues regarding parental notification of abortions for minors. Republicans claim she is independent and hard-working, with an open mind and a lot of common sense. </text> <scu uid=\"4\" label=\"[Senate] Judicary Committee revived/approved/sent/released Brown's

        "summary": "  Barack Obama, a black state senator in Illinois, first came to national attention with his electrifying keynote speech to the Democratic National Convention in July 2004. He went on to win overwhelmingly in the race for U.S. Senator. He was outstanding for his inclusive rhetoric, ability to attract support of liberals and white middle-class voters, and his fund raising for his own and other Democratic candidates. While running his own campaign he stumped for other candidates in more than a dozen states. In November 2004 Barack Obama was already being touted as a future presidential candidate.    Barack Obama graduated Harvard Law School as the first black President of the Harvard Law Review. In 2004 three-term Illinois State Senator Barack Obama won the U.S. Senate seat, with support from white liberals, the white middle class and Chicago south side blacks, to become the third black U.S. Senator in 150 years. He raised a $14 million campaign fund, and gave $400,000 to other Democratic candidates. His lauded keynote speech at the 2004 Democratic Convention kindled such star power he was recruited to stump in a dozen states for presidential nominee John Kerry.    Barak Obama, who was a relatively obscure Senate hopeful just a few months ago, soundly defeated his opponent to become the third African-American US Senator in history. The charismatic Obama catapulted to prominence after giving an electrifying keynote speech at the Democratic National Convention in July. In the following weeks, he came to have such star power that he was recruited to stump for Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry and fellow congressional candidates. He draws the support of voters from all racial and economic groups. Obama is widely touted for a future leadership position in his party.    Barack Obama studied at Columbia and Harvard and led the Harvard Law Review. He became a community organizer in Harlem and Chicago, a civil rights lawyer, and three-term state senator. He won a senatorial nomination over six others in March 2004. He rose to national prominence after his keynote address at the Democratic Convention in July. Annie Leibowitz photographed him for Vanity Fair. He raised $14 million for his campaign and donated to other Democrats. In October he won a landslide victory over Alan Keyes with cross-racial support. He was touted as a future party leader or even presidential candidate. </text> <scu uid=\"47\" label=\"Obama first came to national attention with his speech to the Democratic National Convention in

        "summary": "  On May 3, 2005 former President Bill Clinton announced a partnership of the American Heart Association with the food and restaurant industry to increase physical activity and nutrition at schools nationwide. Other action against childhood obesity followed in August and September as the American Beverage Association agreed to limit distribution of high caloric beverages in schools and Kraft unveiled new whole grain versions of some of the most popular cookies. It was announced in Bangkok, Thailand that fresh fruits, fruit juices and fresh milk would replace sweet and fatty foods in 433 schools across the city.    Former president Clinton launched a 10-year initiative to combat childhood obesity. The initiative, a partnership with the American Heart Association, will include working with the food and restaurant industry to promote change, increasing physical activity and improved nutrition at schools nationwide. School systems are now limiting the kinds of drinks sold to children and requiring more fruits and vegetables in school meals. McDonald's has made a major marketing shift toward promoting healthier eating habits. Kraft Foods has developed whole-grain versions of two of its popular cookies. Abroad, schools in Bangkok, Thailand are banning sugary and fatty foods and drinks.    Dr. George Bray, founding president of the North American Association for the Study of Obesity, warns that high-fructose corn syrup is a strong culprit behind childhood obesity. Bray suggests that childhood obesity can be prevented by getting more sleep, decreasing sedentary activities, drinking more milk (calcium controls weight), thinking portion control and eating breakfast. An Institute of Medicine report found compelling evidence encouraging the food industry to change the nature of foods being marketed to children. Former US president Bill Clinton announced a 10-year initiative to combat childhood obesity.    Illinois is now the only state that requires daily physical activity for public school students but Texas is proposing bills to require that. Former President Clinton his partnered with the American Heart Association to promote physical activity at schools nationwide. Many schools are limiting the kinds of drinks sold to children. California has taken the lead in purging soda and unhealthy snacks from schools. McDonalds's has made a major shift in marketing that could help redefine fast food. Kraft now produces a healthier cookie made with whole grains and containing zero grams of trans fats.  </text> <scu uid=\"33\" label=\"Bill Clinton launched an initiative to combat childhood

        "summary": "  On June 16, 2005 Rep. Randall &quot;Duke&quot; Cunningham insisted there was nothing wrong with his living on a yacht owned by the executive of MZM, Inc. for which he had helped gain government contracts or selling a San Diego home for $1,675,000 to the executive who resold it for $975,000. On July 1 federal agents raided Cunningham's San Diego residence and the MZM offices and yacht in Washington. Cunningham soon announced that he would not seek reelection and the executive stepped down. On August 13 Cunningham asked donors for permission to use their campaign contributions for legal expenses.    By July 2005 U.S. Representative Randall Cunningham was under investigation by the FBI, U.S. Attorney's Office, Defense Criminal Investigative Service, the IRS and a federal grand jury probe. He received defense contractor MZM Inc's PAC money and personal donations from MZM President, Mitchell Wade. Wade paid a supposedly inflated price for Cunningham's and Cunningham paid Wade questionably little money to live on Wade's yacht in DC. Cunningham promoted MZM defense contracts, contributed to and served on a Wade-run charity board, and spoke at an MZM company party. Cunningham requested donors' permission to transfer campaign funds to his legal defense fund.    The FBI and other federal agencies are investigating Rep. Randall &quot;Duke&quot; Cunningham for selling his house in November 2003 to a military contractor, Mitchell Wade, for an inflated price. Agencies are probing Wade's efforts to repay Cunningham for his support in gaining federal contracts. Cunningham was living on Wade's yacht, which has also raised questions about improper financial links. He defended his boat arrangement as proper saying that he paid fees and services in lieu of rent. Cunningham is asking his contributors, including Wade, for permission to use their campaign donations for his legal defense.    Randall &quot;Duke&quot; Cunningham, R-California, is a favorite of defense contractors who contribute heavily to his political campaign. The CEO of one company, MZM, Mitchell Wade, contributes to Cunningham's campaign and PAC, but  supports the congressman in other ways. When in Washington, Cunningham lives aboard Wade's yacht docked at a Potomac River yacht club and pays only docking fees. Wade purchased Cunningham's home in San Diego for over  $1.6M and a few months later sold it for a $700,000 loss suggesting that Cunningham was paid an inflated price. After that sale, Cunningham bought another home for over $2.5M. </text> <scu uid=\"1\" label=\"The FBI  is investigating Rep.

        "summary": "  Ice continues to melt at an alarming rate in both the Arctic and Antarctic. Higher temperatures have shrunk the Arctic ice area 10% and its thickness 42% in 30 years. The permafrost is shrinking, endangering infrastructure. These changes are threatening the culture and economy of the indigenous Artic population. Ice shelves in the Antarctic are collapsing. The melting of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet could raise ocean levels worldwide approximately 15 feet. Increased tourism in the Antarctic is having an environmental impact. Researchers are debating whether greenhouse gases or natural climate cycles are the biggest cause of the melting.    Collapse of coastal Antarctic ice shelves accelerated eight-fold the seaward flow of inland glaciers, raising sea levels: Larsen A (1995), Wilkins (1998), Larsen B (2002), Larsen C (this century). Currents undermine the Ross and Ronne ice shelves, enabling ice flows from deep within the West Antarctic ice sheet. Arctic permafrost thawed; glaciers and sea ice retreated. In 30 years the Arctic ice cap's area shrank by 10%, its thickness by 42%, opening shorter maritime routes when Arctic sea ice disappears in future summers. Siberian lakes disappeared. Indigenous cultures and glacier tourism suffered. Bird migrations shifted. Northern Hemisphere weather will worsen.    In Antarctica and the Artic, ice melts are causing complex questions about the impact of global warming. In Antarctica huge glaciers are thinning and ice shelves are either disintegrating or retreating. These findings are possible indications of global warming. Information gathered about Antarctica coincides with a recent report on accelerating climate changes in the Arctic. A Chinese scientist predicted that the Artic icecap would melt by 2080. The Arctic's indigenous people (about 4 million) are fighting global warming because it will be a threat to their societies, economies and culture.    The thinning of glaciers and ice shelves, as well as the softening of the permafrost, has accelerated greatly in recent years. While it is not certain that the man-made greenhouse effect is entirely to blame, it is clear that man must take steps now to address the problem. Global warming affects everything: oil-platforms, the society of peoples who are indiginous to the polar regions, polar animals, migratory birds, lakes (which are drying up as the permafrost melts), and even tourism. As melting cold fresh water enters the salty sea, it will affect ocean currents and therefore world climate. </text> <scu uid=\"17\" label=\"Ice continues to melt in the Arctic\">  <contributor

        "summary": "  On May 5 UN Chief Kofi Anan announced that the UN team had verified that all Syrian troops and intelligence officials had left Lebanon, but it was reported that the team could not be certain about the intelligence operatives. There were reports that some remained with a hit list of planned assassinations. Syria denied the accusations. The UN envoy had &quot;constructive and helpful&quot; talks with the Syrian president on June 12. One June 23, as another UN verification team investigated, US officials expressed certainty that Syrian military intelligence operatives remained in Lebanon.    By May 23, 2005, a UN team verified the pullout of all Syrian troops and intelligence agents from Lebanon. In June, President Bush warned Syria to withdraw its remaining intelligence agents in Lebanon. Syria denied having any intelligence agents in Lebanon. The UN verification mission went back to Lebanon to ascertain the facts. The UN said it was encouraged by talks with Syria's President regarding evidence from several countries that Syrian intelligence agents were still in Lebanon. Egypt and Saudi Arabia discussed the Syria-Lebanon situation. The U.S. reiterated its certainty that Syrian intelligence agents remained in Lebanon.    Although a U.N. team verified the withdrawal of all Syrian troops from Lebanon on April 26, the US and Lebanese opposition leaders insisted that Syrian intelligence agents remained in Lebanon. The killing of a prominent anti-Syrian journalist aroused suspicions that Syria had a hit list targeting opposition leaders. Syria rejected all accusations. US President Bush issued a new warning to Syria to withdraw intelligence forces. The   U.N. was encouraged by talks with Syria on the Security Council call for Syria to end its involvement in Lebanon. A U.N. verification team was sent to Lebanon by late June to investigate.    A UN team verified the withdrawal of all Syrian troops and intelligence officials from Lebanon after a 29-year presence. International pressure following the assassination of Raafik Hariri was more of a factor leading to the withdrawal than the UN resolution. A Lebanese Druse leader claimed that Syrian military intelligence was still operating in Lebanon and feared more assassinations after a bombing killed an anti-Syrian journalist. These reports caused US President Bush to warn Syria to withdraw its forces from Lebanon. Syria claimed that every troop and agent had left Lebanon. The UN ordered a verification mission back to Lebanon. </text> <scu uid=\"28\" label=\"Another UN investigation\">  <contributor label=\"another UN verification team investigated\">   <part label=\"another UN verification team investigated\" start=\"502\" end=\"543\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"The UN verification mission went back to Lebanon to ascertain the facts\">   <part label=\"The UN verification mission went back to Lebanon to ascertain the facts\" start=\"959\" end=\"1030\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"A U.N. verification team was sent to Lebanon...to investigate\">   <part label=\"A U.N. verification team was sent to Lebanon\" start=\"1947\" end=\"1991\"/>   <part label=\"to investigate\" start=\"2005\" end=\"2019\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"The UN ordered a verification mission back to Lebanon\">   <part label=\"The UN ordered a verification mission back to Lebanon\" start=\"2665\" end=\"2718\"/>  </contributor> </scu> <scu uid=\"19\" label=\"Syria denied the accusations\">  <contributor label=\"Syria denied the accusations\">   <part label=\"Syria denied the accusations\" start=\"368\" end=\"396\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"Syria rejected all accusations\">   <part label=\"Syria rejected all accusations\" start=\"1715\" end=\"1745\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"Syria claimed that every troop and agent had left Lebanon\">   <part label=\"Syria claimed that every troop and agent had left Lebanon\" start=\"2606\" end=\"2663\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"Syria denied having any intelligence agents in Lebanon\">   <part label=\"Syria denied having any intelligence agents in Lebanon\" start=\"903\" end=\"957\"/>  </contributor> </scu> <scu uid=\"1\" label=\"UN team verified troop withdrawal\">  <contributor label=\"UN team had verified that all Syrian troops...had left Lebanon\">   <part label=\"UN team had verified that all Syrian troops\" start=\"108\" end=\"151\"/>   <part label=\"had left Lebanon\" start=\"179\" end=\"195\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"a UN team verified the pullout of all Syrian troops...from Lebanon\">   <part label=\"a UN team verified the pullout of all Syrian troops\" start=\"718\" end=\"769\"/>   <part label=\"from Lebanon\" start=\"794\" end=\"806\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"A UN team verified the withdrawal of all Syrian troops...from Lebanon\">   <part label=\"A UN team verified the withdrawal of all Syrian troops\" start=\"2078\" end=\"2132\"/>   <part label=\"from Lebanon\" start=\"2160\" end=\"2172\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"a U.N. team verified the withdrawal of all Syrian troops from Lebanon\">   <part label=\"a U.N. team verified the withdrawal of all Syrian troops from Lebanon\" start=\"1406\" end=\"1475\"/>  </contributor> </scu> <scu uid=\"26\" label=\"Bush warned Syria to withdraw remaining intelligence agents\">  <contributor label=\"President Bush warned Syria to withdraw its remaining intelligence agents in Lebanon\">   <part label=\"President Bush warned Syria to withdraw its remaining intelligence agents in Lebanon\" start=\"817\" end=\"901\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"US President Bush issued a new warning to Syria to withdraw intelligence forces\">   <part label=\"US President Bush issued a new warning to Syria to withdraw intelligence forces\" start=\"1747\" end=\"1826\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"These reports caused US President Bush to warn Syria to withdraw its forces from Lebanon\">   <part label=\"These reports caused US President Bush to warn Syria to withdraw its forces from Lebanon\" start=\"2516\" end=\"2604\"/>  </contributor> </scu> <scu uid=\"25\" label=\"UN encouraged by talks with Syria\">  <contributor label=\"UN envoy had &quot;constructive and helpful&quot;

        "summary": "  Rioting by young Muslim men broke out in a Paris suburb on the night of Oct. 27, 2005. Cars were torched, windows smashed, and policemen stoned. On successive nights the rioting spread to other parts of Paris and then to other cities. Thousands of police have been deployed to little avail. Fortunately casualties have been light. Some rioters blame the unrest on tough policing policies but it is more likely caused by frustration of young men who have no work and little hope for the future. On Nov. 8 the French government authorized local authorities to impose curfews.    On October 27, 2005 in Paris suburb Clich-sous-Bois, two youth were electrocuted and one injured hiding in a power substation from police. For 12 days riots reached nearly 300 towns and urban Paris. A Clichy-sous-Bois mosque was tear gassed. Buildings were vandalized or firebombed. Paris airport trains halted. Thousands of riot police used tear gas and rubber bullets. A woman was torched. A beaten man died. Over 30 police and firemen were injured, two shot. Nationwide, the nights of November 4 - 7 saw 750, 1,295, 1,408, and 1,173 torched vehicles; 200, 312, 395, and 330 arrests. Bloggers incited violence.    Riots erupted after the accidental electrocution deaths of two youths hiding from police they mistakenly thought were pursuing them. The incident sparked an ever-escalating 12 nights of violence which spread through Paris suburbs and into the city. Rioters torched hundreds of cars nightly, burned and vandalized buildings, injured dozens of police officers and firefighters, set a handicapped woman afire and beat a man to death. French officials appealed for calm and eventually imposed curfews to restore order. The rioters are French-Arab and French-African young men, frustrated by economic misery and racial discrimination and stigmatized by a new tough anti-crime initiative.    Riots have raged for a dozen days in the Paris northern suburb Clichy-sous-Bois. Rioters, mostly young Muslim men whose families are from former French African colonies, have burned hundreds of cars and attacked firefighters and policemen. Police have made hundreds of arrests. The riots started after two teenagers were electrocuted when they scaled an electrical relay station wall while fleeing police and touched a transformer. Tough anti-crime policies of Interior Minister Nicholas Sarkozy fueled the riots. A man died after a beating and a woman was badly burned when exiting a bus. Police and firefighters have sustained minor injuries. </text> <scu uid=\"1\" label=\"Riots broke out\">  <contributor label=\"Rioting...broke out\">   <part label=\"Rioting\" start=\"61\" end=\"68\"/>   <part label=\"broke out\" start=\"89\" end=\"98\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"riots\">   <part label=\"riots\" start=\"843\" end=\"848\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"Riots erupted\">   <part label=\"Riots erupted\" start=\"1362\" end=\"1375\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"Riots have raged\">   <part label=\"Riots have raged\" start=\"2102\" end=\"2118\"/>  </contributor> </scu> <scu uid=\"3\" label=\"Riots began October 27, 2005\">  <contributor label=\"On October 27, 2005...For 12 days riots\">   <part label=\"On October 27, 2005\" start=\"692\" end=\"711\"/>   <part label=\"For 12 days riots\" start=\"831\" end=\"848\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"Rioting...broke out...on the night of Oct. 27, 2005\">   <part label=\"on the night of Oct. 27, 2005\" start=\"117\" end=\"146\"/>   <part label=\"Rioting\" start=\"61\" end=\"68\"/>   <part label=\"broke out\" start=\"89\" end=\"98\"/>  </contributor> </scu> <scu uid=\"4\" label=\"Rioters are young Muslim/Arab/African men\">  <contributor label=\"The rioters are French-Arab and French-African young men\">   <part label=\"The rioters are French-Arab and French-African young men\" start=\"1877\" end=\"1933\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"Rioters, mostly young Muslim men whose families are from former French African colonies\">   <part label=\"Rioters, mostly young Muslim men whose families are from former French African colonies\" start=\"2183\" end=\"2270\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"Rioting by young Muslim men\">   <part label=\"Rioting by young Muslim men\" start=\"61\" end=\"88\"/>  </contributor> </scu> <scu uid=\"5\" label=\"Riots sparked incident in which 2 youths are electrocuted\">  <contributor label=\"The riots started after two teenagers were electrocuted when they scaled an electrical relay station wall while fleeing police and touched a transformer\">   <part label=\"The riots started after two teenagers were electrocuted when they scaled an electrical relay station wall while fleeing police and touched a transformer\" start=\"2380\" end=\"2532\"/>  </contributor>  <contributor label=\"two youth were electrocuted and one injured hiding in a power substation from police.

        "summary": "  The European Airbus A380 flew its maiden test flight from France 10 years after design development started. The A380 super-jumbo passenger jet surpasses the Boeing 747 and breaks their monopoly. Airlines worldwide have placed orders but airports may need modification to accommodate the weight and width of the A380. U.S. airlines have not placed an order. Airbus has fallen behind in production and a backlog of orders has developed. Airbus must sell at least 250 planes to break even financially. The A380 is overweight and modifications to meet the weight requirements impacted the budget. Additional test flights are planned.    Emirate Airlines ordered the first passenger A380 five months before its December 2000 launch. In January Federal Express ordered the first cargo A380. Thirteen non-American airlines have placed 154 orders; China and Hong Kong have options. Commercial deliveries begin first quarter 2006 to Singapore. A380s will land at 25 airports worldwide, including New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami, Chicago, Dulles, Memphis and Anchorage. In February 2001 Airbus's Hamburg plant expanded. Toulouse production started in January 2002. In July 2003 Broughton, Wales got an Airbus plant. The first A380 arrived in January 2005, taking its maiden flight April 27.    The largest passenger airliner ever built, the Airbus 380(A380), took off on its maiden four-hour flight on April 27, 2005 in France. The European company, Airbus, is the newest competitor with the Boeing Company. The A380 is designed to carry 555 passengers, but can be expanded to 800 seats. Airbus stresses the plane's fuel efficiency. Its first test flight was successful. Orders for 149 aircraft from airlines and freight companies have been received. No US airline has ordered the jet yet. First commercial deliveries to Singapore Airlines are scheduled for 2006.    In 1994 Airbus began engineering the A380, a superjumbo airliner larger than Boeing's 747. Component production started in 2002 in Germany and France. A Toulouse, France assembly line opened in 2004. Parts were pared down and new materials introduced to keep the plane at target weight but sent the plane over budget. The A380, carrying between 555 and 840 passengers, was unveiled in January 2005 and test flown in April. Airports need to make design changes to accommodate this overlarge plane that boards on two levels. The US objects to government subsidies to Airbus and airport neighbors complain about noise. </text> <scu uid=\"11\" label=\"Airbus A380 flew its maiden test flight\">  <contributor label=\"Airbus

        "summary": "  In October, 2004, the Dover, PA School Board ordered that biology students be told evolution &quot;is a theory, not a fact&quot; and &quot;intelligent design is an explanation of the origin of life that differs&quot; from evolution, and encouraged to read &quot;Of Pandas &amp; People&quot;, added to the school library. Trial began September, 26, 2005. Plaintiffs argued intelligent design is not scientific, but religious; that board members had religious motivation; and that intelligent design and &quot;Pandas&quot; are recast creationism which has been banned from public school science classes by the Supreme Court as a violation of the first amendment's establishment clause.    The Dover, Pennsylvania school board passed a resolution in October 2004 requiring 9th grade biology students be told that evolution is a theory, not a fact, and that intelligent design is an alternative explanation of the origin of life. The board is being sued by 11 parents of students who charge it is trying to promote a religion in violation of the US Constitution. The school board argues it is informing students about differences of opinion, not endorsing any religious view. The trial is underway.    Pennsylvania's Dover School Board voted requiring teachers to read a brief statement about intelligent design to students before teaching classes on evolution. Intelligent design implies that nature is so complex it must be the work of a single creator rather than evolution. The school board stated that intelligent design provides an alternative to teaching evolution and denies that it is &quot;religion in disguise.&quot; Dover parents brought suit against the school board charging that teaching &quot;intelligent design&quot; is a clear violation of the principle of separation of church and state.    The Dover, Pennsylvania, school board passed a resolution requiring students in a 9th grade biology course be told evolution &quot;is a theory, not a fact&quot; and &quot;intelligent design is an explanation of the origin of life that differs&quot; from evolution. Board members who voted 6-3 for the measure made it clear they believed the origin of life was guided by a heavenly hand. Eleven Dover families are suing the school district alleging the policy violates the constitutional separation of church and state. The American Civil Liberties Union and Americans United for Separation of Church and State are assisting the parents. </text> <scu uid=\"5\" label=\"Dover, PA School Board ordered that a statement

The following day Democrat Gregoire led by 1400; the next day Gregoire by 21,234; and by Nov. 16 Rossi by 19. By Nov 18 all votes were counted and Rossi led by 261. A machine recount gave Rossi a 42-vote edge but a manual recount gave Gregoire a lead of 261. On Dec. 30 Gregoire was declared Governor-elect. On Jan. 7, 2005, with inauguration scheduled for Jan. 12, Rossi filed a lawsuit seeking a new election.    Democrat Christine Grigoire was declared winner in the Washington gubernatorial election two months after election day, winning  by 129 votes out of 2.9 million cast. Republican opponent Dino Rossi filed a lawsuit seeking the extraordinary remedy of a new election. The initial count after the Nov 2 election had Rossi ahead by 261 votes. The first recount reduced his lead to 42 votes. A second recount put Grigoie ahead. An estimated 60% of Washingtonians vote by mail and absentee ballots can be postmarked as late as election day so counting in close races can drag on for weeks.    Until the last days of the campaign, State Attorney General Christine Gregoire (Democrat) was favored to win Washington's 2004 governor's race over wealthy real estate agent Dino Rossi (Republican). Absentee ballots postmarked by Election Day trickled in. Rossi led by 261 votes, triggering a recount required by law if the margin is less than 2000. Following a machine recount, Rossi led by 42 votes. A third count, by hand, took place after Democrats raised sufficient money. Election officials discovered over 700 erroneously rejected or misplaced absentee ballots. Seven weeks after Election Day, Gregoire led by 130 votes, reversing election results.    The race for to be governor of Washington state was extremely close. The initial count showed the Republican candidate, Dino Rossi, ahead by 261 votes out of 2.9 million. The first recount, done by machine, showed him ahead by only 42 votes. The second recount, done by hand, gave Democrat Christine Gregoire a 120-vote lead and she was declared the winner on 30 December, fifty eight days after the election. Rossi has filed a lawsuit, alleging that dead people, felons, and other ineligible voters cast ballots and demanding an unprecedented statewide re-vote. The inauguration may be postponed. </text> <scu uid=\"12\" label=\"First vote count showed Rossi leading\">  <contributor label=\"first vote count showed Republican Rossi leading\">   <part

        "summary": "  Debate continues on whether Pluto discovered in 1930 is a planet or a Kuiper Belt Object (KBO). Up to 100,000 bodies may be in the Kuiper Belt. There is no standard definition of planet and no limit to potential new planets. Pluto's small size, odd orbit and orbital plane is closer to a KBO than a planet. The recently discovered 2003 UB313 beyond Pluto is larger and similar in composition. UB313 is very bright with a skewed orbit and a moon. UB313's mass will be determined from its moon. The International Astronomical Union will decide if UB313 is a planet.      Astronomers have questioned whether Pluto is a planet or a Kuiper Belt Object (KBO), one of a belt of comets, asteroids and other objects at the edge of the solar system. Then on July 29, 2005 Caltech astronomer Michael A. Brown announced discovery of a new body designated 2003 UB313 which is larger than Pluto with a surface very similar to Pluto. The question: is UB313 the tenth planet or should it and Pluto both be considered KBOs? On Sept. 10, Brown announced that UB313, which he considers a planet and has nicknamed Xena, has a moon.    The discovery of 2003 UB313 in the Kuiper Belt, a ring of debris beyond Neptune, will likely rekindle he debate over the definition of &quot;planet.&quot; Until recently, Pluto has been accepted for generations as the ninth planet of the solar system despite its small size and long elliptical orbit angled to the orbital plane of the eight &quot;inner&quot; planets. Like those eight planets, Pluto is spherical, has an atmosphere and seasons and a moon. If Pluto is considered a planet then the similar but larger UB313 is also a planet. Other Kuiper Belt Objects might also merit consideration.     Pluto, discovered in 1930, was named the ninth planet because, though small, it is round like other planets, and has an atmosphere, seasons, and moon. Astronomers now debate downgrading Pluto to Kuiper Belt Object (KBO) because of its similarity to other icy bodies orbiting beyond Neptune. KBOs are being accurately studied by the orbiting Spitzer Space Telescope. A possible new planet in 2005 is 2003 UB313 (2003 EL61), nicknamed Xena. Spanish astronomers also allege the discovery. &quot;Planet&quot; has no official definition. Xena is similar to Pluto, has a moon, also orbits at an angle, and is twice Pluto's size.  </text> <scu uid=\"1\" label=\"Planet status of Pluto is under debate. \">  <contributor label=\"Astronomers

        "summary": "  The ivory-billed woodpecker (Campephilus principalis), thought extinct since 1944, was seen again February 11, 2004 near where it was last seen in the &quot;Big Woods&quot; region of eastern Arkansas. Several independent sightings and video by teams from the Cornell University's Laboratory of Ornithology and the Nature Conservancy, ruled out the similar pileated woodpecker and confirmed the rediscovery, which was kept secret for over a year to prepare to protect the bird's habitat not least from a flood of bird watchers, for which private groups, including The Nature Conservancy spent about $10 million, and the Interior Department committed over $10 million.    The ivory-billed woodpecker, a bird long thought extinct, has been sighted in the swamp forests of eastern Arkansas for the first time in more than 60 years. The bird disappeared after large-scale logging felled thousands of acres of forest. In February 2004, a sighting was thought to be the ivory-billed woodpecker. There have been 15 sightings captured on video although researchers can't determine how many were seen. The government proposed $10 million for efforts to protect the bird. Private groups will contribute another $10 million.     The ivory-billed woodpecker, a magnificent bird long thought extinct, has been sighted in the cypress and tupelo swamp of the Cache River National Wildlife Refuge in Arkansas. Bird experts, government agencies and conservationists kept the discovery secret for more than a year while they worked to confirm the discovery and protect the bird's territory. The ivory-billed woodpecker once ranged from Texas to North Carolina but became extinct in the US because its habitats of old growth forest and swamps were destroyed. There have been 15 sightings of the bird since February 2004 during more than 7,000 hours searching.    The ivory-billed woodpecker, thought for 60 years to be extinct, has been discovered in a remote Arkansas swamp. Its existence has been confirmed by at least 8 sightings, a 4-second video, and its distinctive &quot;double-knock&quot; drumming. The first sighting was in February 2004 but was kept secret for over a year while experts confirmed the discovery and protected the bird's territory. Private groups and individuals have raised $10 million for protection of the woodpecker and its environment, while the federal government has proposed $10 million in federal funds. Massive logging had destroyed the woodpecker's habitat. </text> <scu uid=\"26\" label=\"The ivory-billed woodpecker had been thought to be extinct.\">  <contributor label=\"ivory-billed
