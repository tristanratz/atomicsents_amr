In a Congressional hearing , Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton wondered if was & quot;a dangerous slide into political opinion as opposed to scientific evidence.&quot ; In the absence of federal action , six states have allowed pharmacists to dispense Plan B , the morning - after pill , without a prescription . The religious right led the effort , nationally and in at least 11 states , to give protection to pharmacists who refuse to fill prescriptions for Plan B , the morning - after pill , because of religious beliefs . the FDA was supposed to make a decision on the revised OTC proposal in January 2005 , but the FDA did not . In February the acting the FDA Commissioner was nominated to be Commissioner . the acting FDA Commissioner declared the subject of the pill & quot;complex&quot ; and could not say when a decision would be made . Some senators refused to vote for confirmation until a decision was announced . As the FDA stalled , debate continued and states began to debate local action and such peripheral issues as whether pharmacists are compelled to sell products to which pharmacists have moral objections . On March 31 , 2005 , Senate Democrats questioned the acting FDA Commissioner on the lack of a decision on over - the - counter ( OTC ) sales of the pill . the acting FDA Commissioner called the delay complex . six states already allow OTC sales , with politicians in other states campaigning on over - the - counter ( OTC ) sales of the morning - after pill , recommended by his staff and available with a prescription since the 1990 's . Discussions are heating up over pharmacists refusing to dispense the pill , even with a prescription . Four states have laws giving pharmacists that right and 11 states are considering laws giving them that right . One pharmacist is suing the Governor of Illinois for that right . Several Democratic senators including Kennedy , Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton , Mikulski , and Murray wanted to delay confirmation of President Bush 's nominee to head the FDA until a decision was made on whether the pill could be sold without prescription . Some pharmacists around the country were refusing to fill prescriptions for any birth control pills , claiming that any birth control pills violate Some pharmacists around the country beliefs . At least eleven states allow pharmacists to refuse to fill prescriptions for religious reasons . Massachusetts may join six other states in allowing the pill to be sold without a prescription and four states are considering laws requiring pharmacists to fill all prescriptions .",

California has many solar electricity systems already in operation . Interest is widespread . Portugal plans the world 's biggest solar energy power station . Taiwan claims the best silicon solar cell plant . Italy has Europe 's first solar - powered train . Spain loaned the Philippines $ 4.4 million for a solar project to provide electricity to nearly 300 thousand rural households , schools , potable water systems , and health centers . Portugal planned to begin work on the world 's biggest solar energy power station in 2006 . the world 's biggest solar energy power station was expected to create 240 jobs . The California counties of Fresno and Madera operate 500 solar electricity systems and Long Island powers 560 homes and businesses by solar energy . Italy developed a solar power train that powers air conditioning , illumination , and safety systems . Japan and Wales use solar panels for a portion of train power . Interest in solar power is increasing with large scale projects planned in Portugal and the Philippines . Large energy giants like BP and Royal Dutch Shell are involved in producing equipment . The agricultural valleys of California are considered favorable for solar power . Home conversions to solar power will probably require subsidies to offset initial costs but will lead to low monthly bills . Improvements in semiconductors will aid solar development . Solar panels on trains in Italy and Japan provide for air conditioning , illumination and safety systems . Solar cars and backpacks have been developed . Expectations are high for the growth of solar power . Petroleum industry officials warn solar could become competitive by 2015 . In the US , the solar market is expected to grow by 35 % a year . In California , production increased from 10 megawatts in 2001 to 100 in 2005 . In New York , demand for home systems skyrocketed this year . Portugal is planning a 62 megawatt power station for completion in 2009 . In the Philippines , a $ 63.1 million project is bringing power to rural areas . Taiwan is developing the solar industry chain . Other projects include solar powered trains , cars , and backpack battery chargers .",

Farmers are replacing crops with fields of solar energy panels , thanks to government incentives , which have spurred 150 percent growth in one year . A world leader in renewal energy a decade ago , the U.S. is lagging . For lack of government support , the U.S. share of photovoltaic cell production has dropped from 45 percent in 1996 to 8 percent in 2005 . the U.S. may gain ground by use of technology . One producer predicts that , thanks to technical improvement , the cost of solar systems will drop by two - thirds over the next five years . Italy helped Beijing build a solar energy system for the Olympic Games in 2008 and beyond . China plans to spend $ 180 billion on renewable energy , including substantial solar heat development . Indonesia plans to build thousands of small solar power units to boost power capacity . Taiwan 's renewable energy promotion has yielded the world 's third highest installation density of solar water heaters . Angola developed a plan to supply energy to Angola rural population . a plan to supply energy to its rural population would provide 1300 villages with 15 solar generating plants each . Portugal now has an operating license for the world 's largest solar power station . Indonesia plans thousands of small - scale solar plants to assist remote areas and Angola has a similar 15 - year plan . Italy will help China in building a solar system for hot water for the Olympic Games . China also has a contract with BP Group to develop solar photovoltaic . Germany is the world 's leading solar energy market . California , the third largest market and will increase subsidies for possibly a million rooftop solar panels over the next eleven years . Greece 's president and prime minister have solar panels on official residences . Although California has the world 's 3rd largest market for solar materials , the U.S. is moving slowly toward solar power . Last year , .00067 % of the U.S. electric power came from solar . Germany has the largest world market . China , building a solar powered Olympic village , is planning to expand collection areas to 300 million cubic meters by 2020 and have the photovoltaic market grow from 20 megawatt hours to 10,000 by 2020 . Taiwan 's is proud of having the worlds 3rd highest density of solar water heaters and has a & quot;solar - powered city&quot ; project underway . Angola plans to provide solar power plants to 1,300 villages .",

    "summary": "Europe leads the way in producing energy from wind . It is planned that by 2010 , 22 % of Europe electricity will come from renewal sources . Denmark already receives 18 % of Denmark energy from wind power . Four hundred turbines are to be built in the sea off the coast of Spain . Fishermen claim Four hundred turbines will disturb tuna migration and force Fishermen boats into treacherous waters . A U.S. plan to build 130 turbines in the ocean south of Cape Cod is meeting strong opposition from residents of nearby resorts who say 130 turbines would spoil the view , disrupt fishing and harm birds . The first US offshore wind turbine plan was in Nantucket Sound . Opponents of offshore wind power sought a more comprehensive strategy for wind energy and argued The first US offshore wind turbine plan would spoil vacation area aesthetics , disrupt commercial fishing and harm birds and marine life . One study found The first US offshore wind turbine plan would have little effect on the surrounding air , sea , and animal life or fishing conditions . Another study concluded 130 turbines could alter local weather . Fishermen opposed clusters of windmills on Spain southern shore because clusters of windmills on Spain 's southern shore would disturb tuna migration and necessitate dangerous detours . Proponents of wind turbine generated power consider wind turbine generated power a safe , pollution free , way to reduce dependence on fossil fuels . wind turbine generated power counteracts global warming by reducing greenhouse gases and preserves oil and natural gas resources . Proponents of wind turbine generated power contend there is no harm to the local environment and even attract sightseers . Opponents primarily consider wind farms to be a blight on the landscape that lowers property values , tourism and jobs . Opponents expect off shore farms to disrupt commercial shipping , harm birds and marine life , and impact sport and commercial fishing . Land - based farms are deemed to affect local weather , vegetation and wildlife . Proponents of wind power assert that wind power is a safe , non - polluting , renewable alternative to fossil fuel . Opponents say that the turbines are ugly , disrupt fishing , harm birds and marine wildlife , and affect local weather . Wind power is widely used in Europe , both on land and offshore . Now the first U.S. off - shore wind farm has been proposed for Nantucket Sound . Opponents emphasize the aesthetic impact of the first U.S. off - shore wind farm , while a draft environmental report said that the first U.S. off - shore wind farm would not hinder commercial or sport activities nor would the first U.S. off - shore wind farm kill birds or fish or affect currents , water quality , or noise levels .",

There , wind - powered energy is increasing 15 to 30 percent per year . Big investments in wind power are also being made in Brazil , France , mainland China , Spain , Sweden and Turkey . In 2001 , Texas set a U.S. record by installing more wind power capacity than any other state . But recently , 15 states have surpassed a U.S. record . New York , California and Hawaii have enacted legislation requiring that 20 % of energy companies ' output must come from renewable sources by 2020 . Advocates say a Nantucket wind farm could produce three fourths of electricity needs for the Cape Cod area . Wind farms can reduce reliance on fossil fuel , global warming , and , pollution . a Nantucket wind farm could bring jobs , fish and perhaps a tourist attraction . Opponents argue that Nantucket is the wrong place for a farm . The plan relies on unproved technology . A large wind turbine project is planned in Taiwan . A proposed wind farm overlooking Ireland 's oldest religious site was ruled out for fear A proposed wind farm overlooking Ireland 's oldest religious site would disrupt Ireland 's oldest religious site tranquility . Wind power proponents believe the technology will become competitive as the cost of fossil fuel rises and larger turbines are brought online . Turbines are touted for Turbines low noise and the lack of exhaust gas or water . Two negatives with wind power are wind power dependence on the changeable weather and the distances of farms from population centers . Opposition to wind power becomes more ferocious when planned farms are believed to infringe on the vistas of the wealthy and political influential or on historical , religious sites . Advocates for a Nantucket wind farm maintain that a Nantucket wind farm would bring jobs to the Cape Cod area , that a Nantucket wind farm might be a tourist attraction , and that the towers would attract fish . Opponents say that a Nantucket wind farm relies on unproven technology and that Nantucket is the wrong location . A German group building a project in Taiwan claims that a project will cause no pollution , low noise , and no exhaust gas or waste water - a project is clean , competitive , and inexhaustible . In Ireland 's a project near Ireland 's oldest religious site was abandoned because a project near a very old pilgrimage site would & quot;interfere with Ireland 's oldest religious site tranquility.&quot ;",

A fourth day of storms took a heavy toll as saturated hillsides gave way , mudslides inundating houses and closing highways . People fled neighborhoods up and down the coast . Eight of nine horse races at Santa Anita were canceled for the first time in 10 years . More than 6,000 houses were without power in Los Angeles . A scientist said Los Angeles had not seen such intensity of winter downpours since 1889 - 90 . southern California was drenched by rainstorms in January 2005 . Los Angeles had 15 inches in the first nine days . rainstorms caused severe flooding , sinkholes and mudslides resulting in huge property losses , blocked roads , power outages , hundreds of auto accidents , interruptions of rail traffic , and , by Jan. 10th , twenty deaths . Heroic efforts by hundreds of overtaxed rescue workers saved thousands from collapsed houses , mud piles and floodwaters . Sensitive listening devices and cadaver dogs searched for signs of life in mountains of mud and debris . By Jan 12th good weather was forecast for later in the week . Record - breaking rains brought danger and destruction to southern California in the first weeks of 2005 . The early January 2005 storms dropped more rain in Los Angeles than Los Angeles average annual amount . Several thousand residents endured power outages . Conditions necessitated widespread evacuations . Landslides , mudslides , floods and downed trees caused massive destruction of homes and roads . Stranded motorists required rescue by overtaxed emergency workers . Schools , businesses , rail lines and roads were closed . Beaches were closed for sewage leaks . The number of traffic accidents tripled from the previous dry weekend . In all , The early January storms caused at least 20 deaths and dozens of injuries . southern California was been drenched by storms beginning in late December 2004 , the heaviest drenching in nearly 40 years . Over 15 inches fell during the first nine days . The storm resulted in human deaths and injuries . The storm created flooding , mudslides , and rockslides which caused power outages , evacuations , and disruption of rail services . Beaches , state parks and some mountain and ski resorts were closed . The National Weather Service said flooding , mudslides , and rockslides which caused power outages , evacuations , and disruption of rail services occurs only every 5 - 10 years . The extraordinary weather was attributed to a confluence of tropical air from the South Pacific and a cold front from the North .",

    "summary": "On July 26 Ireland 's deputy prime minister predicted news of a response from the IRA later in the week . The next day senior figures in Sinn Fein departed for the U.S. signaling a forthcoming announcement . An Irish government spokesman warned that an the IRA commitment to non - violence had to be backed by an unambiguous process for disposing of all of the IRA weapons . On July 29 the long - awaited statement arrived declaring that & quot;All the IRA units have been ordered to dump arms.&quot ; U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan hailed the long - awaited statement while British Prime Minister Blair called the long - awaited statement a & quot;very positive&quot ; statement . the IRA has reportedly renounced the IRA armed struggle for a united Ireland . The disposal of the IRA arms remains unclear . Adams did confirm that the IRA was on the verge of making a significant statement . Ahern remained cautious and Northern Ireland Protestant leader Ian Paisley requires absolute proof . U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan hailed renounced and British Prime Minister Blair called the long - awaited statement very positive . The the IRA pledge to lay down the IRA arms and adopt peaceful means to end British rule in Northern Ireland took effect at 4:00 PM on July 28 . American businessman Niall O'Dowd brokered the IRA - US talks leading to a 1994 cease - fire . The 1998 accord established Northern Ireland local government . In December 2004 Sinn Fein rejected Protestant demands that the IRA arms destruction be photographed , halting political progress . Following Adams April 2005 appeal to lay down arms the IRA consulted with members . Sinn Fein leaders visited the U.S. but entry was denied to fugitive Rita O'Hare . In July the IRA declared an end to violence . the IRA ordered quot;All IRA units to dump arms , inviting Protestant and Catholic clergymen to serve as witnesses . the IRA refused to disband as Protestants demanded . In late August , the IRA ordered an end to the IRA armed campaign in Northern Ireland , declaring there is an alternate way to achieve a united Ireland , free from British rule . If The IRA pledge to lay down its arms and adopt peaceful means to end British rule in Northern Ireland holds , it will be a historic turning point in the violent history of Ireland 's and Northern Ireland . The majority Protestant party is expected to demand a one year delay in power sharing .

    "summary": "In October 2004 , Sri Lanka 's Tamil Tiger rebel group blamed Sri Lanka 's for delay in reviving negotiations to end the conflict that had claimed 60,000 lives since 1972 . Sri Lanka 's Tamil Tiger rebel group suspended talks in April 2003 when internecine struggles broke out between rebel groups . Sri Lanka 's claims Sri Lanka 's Tamil Tiger rebel group are holding up negotiations and accuses Sri Lanka 's Tamil Tiger rebel group of killing over 250 of Sri Lanka 's Tamil Tiger rebel group political rivals since the truce of 2002 went into effect . Sri Lanka 's released ten Tamil Tigers from jail on bail , and Sri Lanka 's Tamil Tiger rebel group responded by freeing two homeguards who had been held hostage since August . Negotiations under the Norwegian - sponsored peace process of February 2002 between The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) and Sri Lanka 's were at a standstill in October 2004 due in part to internecine struggles within The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) . The main LTTE in northern Sri Lanka was challenged by a faction in the east with a leader known as Karuma who broke ranks in March 2004 . While The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) sought support in Europe and Japan offered help in resumption of negotiations , Sri Lanka 's blamed The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) for breakdown of the peace process which has been stalled since April 2003 . A group from The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) met in Switzerland to prepare for talks with Sri Lanka 's . A cease in Switzerland brokered by Norwegian - sponsored has been observed since February 2002 ; however , internecine clashes between The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) and rival groups counter efforts to revive negotiations between The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) and the government of Sri Lanka . Sri Lanka 's has sent counterproposals to the Interim Self Government to those put forward by The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) . Violence continues and a Swiss national was killed . Japanese envoy Akashi was to arrive in Sri Lanka 's to push for resumption of talks . Efforts to revive talks between The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) and the government of Sri Lanka have been stalled by persistent clashes between rival rebel groups and by continued killings . In early October the top rebel group was in Switzerland to prepare for the next round of talks , while Sri Lanka 's said that Sri Lanka 's had finalized a set of counter proposals for the resumption of direct negotiations . Japan special envoy arrived in Sri Lanka 's on 27 October for a 7 - day visit to encourage an early resumption of peace talks .

    "summary": "On June 27 , 2005 the Supreme Court , in a pair of 5 - 4 rulings , found that the display of the Ten Commandments ( T.C. ) in a park at the Texas State Capitol was proper , but the displays in the County Courthouses in Kentucky were so overtly religious as to be impermissible . a pair of 5 - 4 rulings made it clear that such disputes must be decided case by case with specific facts determining whether there is a violation of the Establishment Clause . Justice Breyer was the swing vote as the only justice voting with the majority in both cases . While hearing arguments , the Supreme Court justices seemed to grapple for a standard which would keep the government from endorsing a religion without eradicating the government historical and cultural ties to religion . On June 27 , the Supreme Court ruled that displaying the Ten Commandments ( T.C. ) on government property does not necessarily violate the constitutional principle of separation between church and state . the Supreme Court ruled that the monument displayed at the Texas State Capitol , one of thousands donated across the government and displayed along with 16 other secular sculptures , was proper . However , the Supreme Court ruled that the courthouse displays in Kentucky were overtly religious and therefore impermissible . the Supreme Court ruled 5 - 4 that the display of the Ten Commandments ( T.C. ) in a park at the Texas State Capitol did not violate constitutional principles . Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote for the Supreme Court and was joined by Justices Scalia , Kennedy , Thomas and Justice Breyer . Justices O'Connor , Stevens , Souter and Ginsburg dissented . In Kentucky , the prevailing opinion was that the displays in the County Courthouses in Kentucky was overtly religious and thus impermissible . Souter wrote the opinion and was joined by Justices Stevens , O'Connor , Ginsburg and Justice Breyer . a pair of 5 - 4 rulings conveyed the message that disputes over religious displays must be decided on a case by case . the Supreme Court made a pair of 5 - 4 rulings , leaving the issue to be decided on a case - by - case basis . Justice Breyer cast the critical swing vote in both cases . the Supreme Court ruled that the display of the Ten Commandments ( T.C. ) in a park at the Texas State Capitol was constitutional because the display of the Ten Commandments ( T.C. ) in a park at the Texas State Capitol was one of 17 monuments , the display of the Ten Commandments ( T.C. ) in a park at the Texas State Capitol had historical as well as religious significance , and the display of the Ten Commandments ( T.C. ) in a park at the Texas State Capitol had been there for over 40 years without challenge . In contrast , in Kentucky the Ten Commandments ( T.C. ) were initially displayed alone ; the accompanying historical documents were added in response to a lawsuit , seemingly to hide a religious motivation .",

New rules on voting provided that the required 2/3 majority of cardinals would revert to a single majority if no decision had been reached after several days . On the morning of April 18 , 2005 , Cardinal Ratzinger , a prominent contender for pope , delivered a homily strongly endorsing orthodoxy . That afternoon , after the first voting session , a signal of white smoke from The Sistine Chapel roof , which would indicate election of a pope , turned to black , showing that no decision had been made . On Sunday , April 17 , 115 Roman Catholic cardinals representing 52 countries and six continents arrived at the Vatican to select a successor to Pope John Paul II . On Monday , 115 Roman Catholic cardinals representing 52 countries and six continents convened a conclave , a secret and sacred gathering , in Sistine Chapel . Following 115 Roman Catholic cardinals representing 52 countries and six continents oath , the selection process began . A two - thirds majority is required to elect a pope . Outside , attention was focused on The Sistine Chapel roof , watching for the white smoke of burning ballots that would indicate a successful election . Monday , black smoke rose from the chimney . 115 Roman Catholic cardinals representing 52 countries and six continents would return twice daily , beginning Tuesday , for additional ballots . The conclave was introduced to inconvenience cardinals and thus speed up The process for electing a pope . Today The conclave helps preserve secrecy . The opening pageant is televised , then all news media and audiovisual or communication equipment is banned . Cardinals move into St. Martha 's House and are forbidden to talk to anyone not sworn to secrecy . In 1996 Pope John Paul II instituted new rules concerning choosing a pope . Until a two - thirds majority is reached the pattern is seven ballots and a day of rest . If a deadlock remains after 12 days , voting may resort to simple majority . Bells will ring when a pope is elected . On April 18 , 2005 , 115 Roman Catholic cardinals representing 52 countries and six continents were sequestered in the Vatican to elect a new pope . After a televised mass , 115 Roman Catholic cardinals representing 52 countries and six continents took the cardinals ' oath , then moved to Sistine Chapel . 115 Roman Catholic cardinals representing 52 countries and six continents meet twice a day , voting twice each session , until one man receives a 2/3 's majority . After each vote the ballots are burned - black smoke signals no one was elected . When a pope is chosen , white smoke will be accompanied by bells . Pilgrims in St. Peter 's Square watched white smoke .",

    "summary": "Although many said there was no clear front - runner among the 115 cardinals , Ratzinger 's sermon at the pre - conclave mass put Ratzinger 's in the limelight for conservatives . On April 19th white smoke rising from the chapel roof at 5:15 p.m. stayed white . Ratzinger 's had been chosen after four ballots . Ratzinger 's victory was cheered widely as an extension of the legacy of John Paul II , but questioned by more liberal elements concerned by a sharply divided church . There was hope in Ratzinger 's explanation that Ratzinger 's would be Benedict XVI after Benedict XV who gave himself to & quot;peacemaking , reconciliation and harmony.&quot ; On April 19th , white smoke puffed from the chapel chimney , signaling the election of Ratzinger 's . After four ballots , Roman Catholic cardinals elected Ratzinger 's . Ratzinger 's took the name Pope Benedict XVI . In the 13th century cardinals spent more time hunting and feasting than seriously deliberating , so in 1271 a mob tore the roof off cardinals meeting place , exposing cardinals to the elements , and gave cardinals only bread and water to force a decision . Now cardinals are locked up until cardinals decide . Previously , conclaves were held in the town where the last pope died . Smoke became the logical means of signaling a decision because ballots needed to be burned . After John Paul II death the Vatican stipulated that special chemicals be added to the smoke and bells be rung to avoid confusion . In April 19th , Ratzinger 's was the election of a new pope on the fourth ballot , signaled by the white smoke and tolling bells . Following the election of a new pope , Ratzinger 's accepted and announced the name Pope Benedict XVI . Ratzinger 's was then taken to a dressing chamber nicknamed the & quot;Room of Tears&quot ; , where Ratzinger 's donned the papal vestments . A Chilean cardinal then proclaimed & quot;We have a pope!&quot ; from the central balcony over St. Peter 's Square where thousands of pilgrims were gathering . Ratzinger 's then appeared and made a brief speech . the 115 cardinals were on surrounding balconies .",

    "summary": "By April 2005 five states were in revolt against the Patriot Act , urging that restrictions be placed on the Patriot Act broad powers . The & quot;library provision&quot ; that allowed searching of library records , caused five states and 375 communities in 43 states to pass anti - the Patriot Act resolutions , the ACLU said . Nevertheless , the Bush administration continued the Bush administration campaign to preserve the Patriot Act and even to expand the Patriot Act . Congress considered legislation that could enlarge the FBI 's ability to wiretap people whom the FBI 's suspected were security risks . Also , legislation that could enlarge the FBI 's ability to wiretap people whom it suspected were security risks would lift a restriction on special warrants , that information obtained must be related to terrorism . Congress began consideration of the Patriot Act renewal on April 4 , 2005 . By then five states and 375 communities in 43 states had passed resolutions warning of the Patriot Act excesses . Senators Craig ( R - ID ) and Durbin ( D - IL ) had drafted The Safety and Freedom Enforcement Act ( SAFE ) eliminating the three main targets of the civil libertarians . the Bush administration pushed for making the Patriot Act permanent . Testimony by the Attorney General and the FBI 's Director opened the debate . By June the Bush administration case was made in draft legislation offered by Sen. Roberts ( R - KS ) further strengthening federal powers and countering The Safety and Freedom Enforcement Act ( SAFE ) . Anti - the Patriot Act resolutions were adopted in five states and 375 communities . While Congress debated making the Patriot Act provisions permanent , there was strong bipartisan support for retaining the & quot;sunset&quot ; provisions to ensure Justice Department accountability . Critics of the Patriot Act sought changes to limit the Patriot Act in several ways , including informing suspects of & quot;sneak and peek&quot ; searches within 7 days unless a judge intervened . The Senate Intelligence Committee met behind closed doors to consider a draft bill that would escalate government police powers . a draft bill that would escalate government police powers was viewed as a Republican maneuver to shift arguments to expanding the Patriot Act . Delayed Notification Searches ( called sneak and peek ) are the central issue regarding extending , modifying or curbing executive powers under the Patriot Act . Justice Department urges extension . the ACLU and some conservative libertarians call for curbing powers . Five state legislatures and several communities have passed resolutions to limit executive powers . A bill by Senators Craig ( R - ID ) and Durbin ( D - IL ) would amend the Patriot Act . A draft bill by The Senate Intelligence Committee would extend the FBI 's powers . Gonzales said at one point the Patriot Act had been used 35 times . Later , 35 times was given as 155 times as of January 2005 .",

IBM , Apple supplier for 14 years , was unable to deliver IBM , its supplier for 14 years , new PC chip that promised more power and less heat , both needed for laptops Apple planned . switch was a gamble for Apple because software developers would have to re - engineer all programs for Intel chips . Intel celebrated switch , although Macintosh held only 2 % of the market . IBM , its supplier for 14 years , was not badly hurt ; IBM , its supplier for 14 years , had long planned to concentrate on chips for computer games . Steve Jobs is preparing to abandon Apple 14 - year commitment to chips developed by IBM , its supplier for 14 years , and Motorola in favor of Intel processors . Apple has been frustrated by IBM , its supplier for 14 years , failure to deliver a G5 chip that does not generate much heat . After weeks of rumors , Steve Jobs announced that switch would be made by 2007 . Apple must now persuade software developers to make software developers programs run on Intel chips . Apple operating system is viewed as more stable and secure than Windows . Intel CEO said Intel 's CEO company is thrilled to have Apple as a customer . Steve Jobs told software engineers at Apple annual developer conference in San Francisco that Apple will discontinue using IBM and Motorola chips in favor of Intel microprocessors . Apple engineers have secretly worked on switch for five years . Every edition of Macintosh since then has been designed to run on both IBM , its supplier for 14 years , and Intel chips . Apple is producing Developer Transition Kits that will allow software developers to prepare applications to run on both IBM and Intel chips . Apple lower - end computers , like the Mac Mini , will get Intel chips in June 2006 . Apple entire computer line will have Intel chips by December 2007 . On 6 June Apple announced plans to abandon Apple 14 - year ties with IBM and Motorola in favor of Intel processors . Apple had been frustrated by IBM , its supplier for 14 years , inability to develop a chip that could process large amounts of data without overheating . Apple programs will have to be rewritten to run on an Intel - powered Mac , although engineers have already developed codes to ease switch . Apple could lose sales in the short term , as people wait for switch . The first Intel - powered Macs are scheduled for June 2006 ; The first Intel - powered Macs should be switch by the end of 2007 .",

Mission control reported a fuel shortage : 2600 lbs . less than Mission control had figured . Fossett decided to press on to Hawaii admitting the fuel problem was & quot;a huge setback.&quot ; Before reaching Hawaii Fossett announced that Fossett would continue on to Salina . By 0930GMT March 3 Global Flyer was southwest of California and that afternoon , after 67 hours in flight , Fossett glided into a perfect landing to the cheers of all of Salina and much of the world . On Wednesday after nearly 29 flight hours Fossett reached Fossett halfway point over India . While relying on autopilot , Fossett could not ignore the complex demands of Global Flyer for more than 10 - 20 minutes at a time . On Wednesday , while flying over mainland China mission control officials reported Fossett fuel was 450 gallons less than expected . Fossett decided to fly to Hawaii to re - evaluate the situation . There Fossett decided to proceed . The jet stream and great tailwinds over the Pacific allowed Fossett to make up time . Fossett made a perfect landing in Salina after a 67 - hour flight . Fossett reached his halfway point over India while flying over India and Fossett also picked up a 100 MPH jet stream boost . While Fossett was over mainland China , mission control officials concluded that Fossett had less fuel than mission control officials had counted on . Despite concluded , Fossett decided to press on to Hawaii . On the final legs of a 67 - hour flight , Fossett stayed awake by drinking a dozen chocolate protein milkshakes . Slightly over 67 hours after departure from Salina , Fossett landed Global Flyer on the same airstrip from which Fossett had departed . Global Flyer had enough fuel remaining to fly another 10 hours . Fossett continued a 67 - hour flight , reaching the half - way point over Myanmar at 0705 GMT on Wednesday . Over mainland China there was concern about the fuel supply , but Fossett decided to continue to Hawaii and at 2000 was east of Japan . As Fossett was north of Hawaii , Fossett again decided to continue because The jet stream was so strong . By 0930 on Thursday , Fossett was 1,151 miles southwest of California . Fossett landed at Salina , at 1948 GMT . Fossett had taken just over 67 hours to fly a 23,000 mile zigzag course around the world .",

    "summary": "Prosecutors changed tactics in the retrial of Kozlowski and Swartz from accusations of lavish spending used in the first trial , to a focus on charges that Kozlowski and Swartz had awarded Kozlowski and Swartz millions of dollars and concealed it from the board of Tyco . A retired board chairman testified A retired board chairman was never told about millions in forgiven loans and bonuses for Kozlowski and Swartz . Tyco former head of finance testified A retired board chairman never saw that millions of dollars in special bonuses were approved by a compensation committee . Tyco 's former head of finance also said Tyco 's former head of finance was n't aware of any documents to that effect . In Prosecutors case , former Tyco executives were questioned , sometimes for days , about former Tyco executives knowledge or lack thereof about loans forgiven and bonuses paid to Kozlowski . On April 27 , Kozlowski took the stand in Kozlowski defense . Kozlowski denied abusing company loans and bonuses , testifying that A retired board chairman approved company loans and bonuses . Kozlowski did admit to forgetfully omitting $ 25 million bonus that did not appear on Kozlowski 1999 tax return . Cross - examination , which began on April 28 , turned decidedly contentious by the third day . Kozlowski maintained Kozlowski innocence and defended Kozlowski lavish spending throughout . Prosecutors in the first trial say Kozlowski and Swartz stole $ 150 M by improperly forgiving company loans to Kozlowski and Swartz , taking unauthorized bonuses and having Tyco pay personal expenses . In a surprise move , Kozlowski testified in Kozlowski own defense . Kozlowski portrayed Kozlowski as an earnest , often harried , executive who rose through the ranks and had the support of the board of Tyco . Kozlowski could not explain why a $ 25 M bonus did not appear on Kozlowski tax return . Kozlowski finished four days of testimony insisting that Kozlowski left it to lawyers and accountants to decide what to tell shareholders about Kozlowski compensation . A retired board chairman said A retired board chairman was never told about millions in forgiven loans and bonuses for the two executives . Tyco 's former head of finance said A retired board chairman was unaware of compensation committee approval for millions in forgiven loans and bonuses for the two executives . Kozlowski took the stand in the retrial of Kozlowski and Swartz . Kozlowski said A retired board chairman had approved millions in forgiven loans and bonuses for the two executives . Kozlowski thought a $ 20 million fee Kozlowski paid a board member for arranging an acquisition did not require board authorization . Not including forgiven debt on Kozlowski tax form was an oversight . Kozlowski assistant decided to use Tyco loan money for certain payments but Kozlowski conceded Kozlowski responsibility .",

Carbon sequestration is not new ; petroleum producers have pumped compressed CO2 into oil - bearing structures to force oil to the surface for years . Norway has buried 70 million tons below the North Sea . Carbon dioxide from a coalgas plant in Wyoming is pumped 185 miles to a working oilfield in Canada . In 2004 scientists planned to sequester carbon in deep sandstone deposits . Coal gasification is necessary for sequestration . Improving the two technologies was part of a $ 35 billion package the Senate considered in 2005 . Carbon sequestration has been tested in the United States , Canada and Britain using old or working oil or gas fields as storage areas . Since 1996 Norway has buried 70 million tons below the North Sea . In each case 70 million tons , after being captured by solvents , would be pumped into geologic formations which were thought to be safe storage areas . As efficient technology to compress , transport and store 70 million tons is developed 70 million tons could be provided to developing countries such as China and India offering help in the fight against global warming . Carbon sequestration , the process of capturing carbon dioxide produced by burning fossil fuels and storing carbon dioxide produced by burning fossil fuels under the ground or ocean floor , is not a new idea and is gaining support . In Texas , scientists are burying tons of compressed carbon dioxide beneath an old oil field . Norway has buried tons below North Sea oilfields . The energy industry now injects compressed CO2 into the ground to make it easier to get oil out of the ground . Environmentalists say the plan is worth pursuing if safe , reliable , and dependent on cost . The question arises if Carbon sequestration , the process of capturing carbon dioxide produced by burning fossil fuels and storing it under the ground or ocean floor , could cause an earthquake . Norway has stored waste CO2 below a North Sea oilfield since 1996 . Texas geologists are pumping compressed CO2 into a sandstone layer one mile beneath an old Louisiana - Texas oil field . CO2 from a coalgas plant in Wyoming is being pumped under a working Weyburn , Saskatchewan oilfield . Britain will pump CO2 from a Scottish power station to an old North Sea oil reservoir . the United States backs carbon sequestration development and coal gasification technology that can sequester siphoned - off CO2 , and plans to use carbon sequestration for mercury control . Arizona is investigating combining CO2 with plentiful minerals to form chemically stable substances .",

    "summary": "The U.S. Energy Department announced that an experimental carbon sequestration project had been successful . CO2 from a coal burning plant in North Dakota was pumped to an oilfield in Canada . an experimental carbon sequestration project removed five million tons of CO2 . Subsidiaries of BP and Edison International planned to build a $ 1 billion power plant in California that would capture 90 % of the carbon dioxide produced and pump 90 % of the carbon dioxide produced into an oilfield . Oil companies Statoil ASA and Royal Dutch Shell PLC announced plans for similar plants . A pilot energy plant in Denmark using similar technology was scheduled to start in March 2006 . In Sept. 2005 a United Nations report said that application of carbon sequestration to power plants would become economical and that 99 percent of the carbon would not leak during the next 1000 years . In November The U.S. Energy Department revealed than an experimental project with sequestration in a live oil field brought more oil to the surface . In 2006 plans were announced for similar projects in Britain and Norway with a Norwegian expert saying their project could increase oil recovery by at least 155 million barrels in their project lifetime . A United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change suggests carbon dioxide emissions should be captured from generating plants and refineries then compressed and stored in geological formations , oceans or in minerals . Underground storage could use technology already developed by the oil and gas industry . The U.S. Energy Department estimates that one - third to one - half of the emissions released into the atmosphere could be eliminated by Underground storage . BP and Edison International subsidiaries plan to build a plant in Carson , California , where 90 % of the carbon dioxide would be captured and pumped into an oilfield . A similar Danish project is underway . United Nations and EU recommend carbon sequestration . EU signed an agreement with China that encourages carbon sequestration . Carbon sequestration tests in Algeria were promising . A joint US - Canadian project injects CO2 from coal gasification in ND into the Weyburn oil field in Saskatchewan . BP plans a power plant in Scotland that will sequester CO2 , and with Edison International , one adjacent to a BP refinery in Carson , California . Statoil ASA and Royal Dutch Shell PLC plan a power plant in Tjeldbergodden , Norway , that will provide CO2 to Draugen and Heidrun offshore oil and gas fields . Massachusetts suggests companies plant trees that absorb CO2 .",

    "summary": "Swedish researchers discovered that children of older fathers face an enhanced risk of developing schizophrenia . an enhanced risk of developing schizophrenia increases with the age of the father . Unfortunately , trends in developed countries are toward delaying parenthood . Several studies have found that , at least in teenagers , heavy cannabis use can be a contributory cause in triggering schizophrenia . Australian researchers have found a link between the impaired thought processes in schizophrenia and thinning grey matter in the brain . schizophrenia evidently has a genetic component , but changes in the epigenome , natural chemical modifications of genes , after birth , may hold a clue to schizophrenia non - genetic aspects . There are statistical studies and partial explanations of the cause of schizophrenia , but no complete theory . Children born of older fathers are at higher risk . No schizophrenia - causing gene has been identified , but a few victims display a gene - mutation associated with Rett syndrome . Heavy daily use of marijuana starting before age 15 causes increased risk , but the risk decreases with age . Australian researchers found thinning of the outer layer of grey matter in the brain of victims . Other studies suggest environmental and social factors or natural chemical changes in a person 's genome . Research shows a strong link between schizophrenics and schizophrenics fathers ' age , demonstrating a hereditary factor exacerbated by sperm mutations that accumulate with age . Australian researchers linked the impaired thought process involved with schizophrenia to the thinning of grey matter in the brain . A growing body of research indicates that years of heavy marijuana ( also known as cannabis ) use significantly increases the risk of developing schizophrenia . The malfunction of certain microcircuits in the brain may cause schizophrenia . A study suggests that the epignome may hold a clue to schizophrenia nongenetic aspects . The older the father , the greater children 's risk of developing schizophrenia . Heavy marijuana use over years increases schizophrenia risk . Impaired thought processes in schizophrenics have been linked to a thinning outer layer of brain grey matter . the epigenome , natural chemical modifications of genes and a mutation of the methyl - CpG - binding protein 2 gene each may be involved in schizophrenia . A detailed model of the brain 's circuitry being developed in Switzerland , might help show why malfunctions that cause schizophrenia occur . DNA biopsy may allow testing for schizophrenia in utero and finding damaged genes in schizophrenics . A search of Iceland 's comprehensive records failed to find a schizophrenia - causing gene .",

    "summary": "Studies of famines years ago in Holland and China revealed that children born of severely malnourished mothers were twice as likely to develop schizophrenia as others . Scientists knew that vitamin A plays an important role in schizophrenia , Alzheimer 's and Parkinson 's ; now Scientists 've discovered vitamin A acts upon a gene that influences neuron activity . Damage to the enzyme PDE4B increases the risk of developing mental illness , and researchers have discovered that a gene that influences neuron activity acts as a regulator for the enzyme PDE4B Some scientists believe that lack of insulin in the brain may cause schizophrenia , but Some scientists reject & quot;insulin shock therapy,&quot ; popular mid-20th century . Recent studies demonstrate that schizophrenia has a genetic basis and results from chemical abnormalities in the brain . The long - standing belief in problems of childhood as a cause has been largely discarded , but environmental factors are still seen as playing a role . Famine , malnutrition , or infection of a pregnant woman may cause changes in a developing fetal brain and heavy smoking of marijuana by teenagers may trigger a genetic predisposition . One study identifies insulin as a factor . The same 14 genes found missing in the brains of schizophrenics were missing in the muscles of diabetics . A renowned psychiatrist believed that schizophrenia was related to neurological impairments rather than childhood problems . Recent studies have demonstrated that disorders like schizophrenia have a genetic basis . Evidence that children from malnourished women are more likely to develop schizophrenia supports the theory that schizophrenia is caused by a genetic predisposition influenced by environmental triggers . Researchers found that levels of a chemical messenger in the brain called GABA were abnormal in schizophrenics and linked to a miswired network . For decades scientists linked schizophrenic symptoms to abnormalities in the brain chemical dopamine . Studies later identified genes that make people susceptible to schizophrenia . Research shows that schizophrenia is caused by a genetic predisposition influenced by environmental triggers , including infection and severe maternal malnutrition , that disturb the developing fetal brain . vitamin A , possibly proteins the enzyme PDE4B and a gene that influences neuron activity , and reduced a chemical messenger in the brain called GABA and insulin levels play roles in schizophrenia . the brain chemical dopamine is linked to schizophrenic delusions and hallucinations . Other brain chemicals contribute to confusion and emotional unresponsiveness . Smoking pot in adolescence increases schizophrenic risk . Fourteen genes are missing in schizophrenics ' brains .

Saturn 's largest moon , Titan is the only moon in the Solar System that has an atmosphere . During the seven years its mothership took to reach Saturn 's , the space probe , Huygens , was powered through an umbilical cable and awakened from sleep mode every six months for tests . After a seven - year journey , the space probe , Huygens , successfully separated from its mothership at about 10:24 p.m. EST December 24,2004 , beginning the space probe , Huygens , three - week , 2 million - mile free fall toward Saturn 's moon Titan . the space probe , Huygens , will remain dormant until January 14 , when the space probe , Huygens , will float to the surface on parachutes , shooting pictures and sending back data for about 2.5 hours before hitting the surface . Scientists hope the space probe , Huygens , will confirm the assumption that Saturn 's largest moon , Titan atmosphere is similar to that of early Earth . The mission is a joint project of NASA 's , the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency . the space probe , Huygens , is a 9 - foot landing probe , built by the European Space Agency . the space probe , Huygens , is riding on its mothership . its mothership flew twice past Venus , once past early Earth , and once past Jupiter - 2.2 billion miles - before its mothership first orbit around Saturn 's began on July 1 , 2004 . its mothership continued these orbits until December 24,2004 . On December 24,2004 , the space probe , Huygens , separated from its mothership and began a forecasted 20 - day , 2.5 million mile ballistic path to Saturn 's largest moon , Titan . the space probe , Huygens , is designed to study Saturn 's largest moon , Titan atmosphere and take photographs . the space probe , Huygens , was carried by NASA 's Cassini spacecraft on a seven - year journey . the space probe , Huygens , separated successfully from its mothership on Christmas Eve and began a 2.5 - million - mile 20 - day descent to Saturn 's largest moon Titan , the only moon in the Solar System that has atmosphere . During a 2.5 - million - mile 20 - day descent to Saturn 's largest moon Titan , the only moon in the solar system that has atmosphere the space probe , Huygens , will sample Titan 's atmosphere . Everything must work perfectly because there is no way to adjust the space probe , Huygens , course . Progress was being carefully followed by NASA 's and the 16 European nations involved in The mission .",

Photographs the Huygens space probe took near the surface revealed a frigid realm of apparent rivers , lakes and icy boulders . Scientists were ecstatic at having achieved the first spacecraft landing on the moon of another planet . the first spacecraft landing on the moon of another planet , represented the farthest from Earth that a spacecraft had ever landed , about 890 million miles away . Titan dense hydrocarbon smog suggests complex chemical processes like those that led to life on Earth . European scientists built the Huygens space probe to learn more by probing the surface . the Huygens space probe landed safely on the surface as scheduled on January 14 , 2005 . Mission controllers were confident the Huygens space probe landed on a solid , soft surface . the Huygens space probe continued to send back pictures and data after landed , and would continue to do so until the Huygens space probe batteries ran out . The initial black and white images of the surface sent by the Huygens space probe before noon EST astonished scientists . the first spacecraft landing on the moon of another planet , represents the farthest from Earth that a spacecraft has landed . the first spacecraft landing on the moon of another planet also is the first landing of a spacecraft on the moon of another planet . the Huygens space probe landed safely on the surface on January 14 , 2005 . The initial black and white images of Titan 's surface sent by Huygens before noon EST brought gasps and cheers from the scientists . The initial black and white images of Titan 's surface sent by Huygens before noon EST appeared to reveal drainage channels , flooded plains , shore lines , and a surface strewn with frozen blocks . the Huygens space probe had gathered environment data and photographs for 3 hours during the Huygens space probe descent and for 10 minutes on the surface before the batteries died . The mission was declared a fantastic success and The mission output will be studied for years . the Huygens space probe is & quot;a fantastic success for Europe.&quot ; During the 2 - 1/2 - hour descent through Titan atmosphere , the Huygens space probe filmed the surface , measured wind speed and pressure , and analyzed the atmosphere . The first pictures , taken from a height of about 10 miles as the Huygens space probe descended , showed a strange , rugged terrain with drainage channels for liquids . the Huygens space probe landed safely on the surface at about 1234 GMT on January 14 , 2005 and the sensors , which were expected to work for only three minutes after landed , continued to function for at least 30 minutes .",

Justices Stevens , Souter , Ginsburg and Breyer were expected to vote against the death penalty for crimes committed by 16 - 17 - year - olds while Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices Scalia and Thomas would be for the death penalty for crimes committed by 16 - 17 - year - olds . Justices Kennedy and O'Connor appeared to be & quot;swing votes.&quot ; In the initial hearing Kennedy expressed concerns about exempting 16 - 17 - year - olds but also noted that & quot;world opinion is against us&quot ; in executing juveniles . O'Connor noted that several states had already raised the minimum age for execution to 18 . On October 13 , 2004 , the Supreme Court struggled over the legality of the death penalty for crimes committed by 16 - 17 - year - olds in Roper vs. Simmons . Simmons attorney argued that a national consensus has emerged that the death penalty for crimes committed by 16 - 17 - year - olds is cruel and unusual punishment . Simmons ' attorney compared Roper vs. Simmons to the 2002 case in which the Supreme Court abolished the death penalty for mentally retarded offenders . Simmons ' attorney argued that the Supreme Court should uphold the execution of minors because some crimes are so heinous as to warrant the execution of minors . Justices Kennedy 's and Day O'Connor 's votes are likely to be pivotal . the Supreme Court heard arguments on Roper vs. Simmons on October 13 , 2004 . the Supreme Court decision will determine whether the death penalty for crimes committed by 16 - 17 - year - olds can be given for crimes committed by 16 and 17 year olds . the Supreme Court ended the death penalty for those 15 and younger in 1988 and mentally retarded in 2002 . The outcome appears dependent on the votes of Justices Kennedy and O'Connor . Key issues are has the nation 's consensus changed , should world consensus influence US law , and the brain development of these youngsters . Since 1976 , 22 have been executed . Now 73 people are on death row in 12 states . In Roper vs. Simmons the Supreme Court heard arguments challenging the constitutionality of the death penalty for crimes committed by 16 - 17 - year - olds . The defense argued that minors were not fully developed intellectually or morally and that therefore such executions violate the constitution 's ban on cruel and unusual punishment . The defense asserted that a national consensus had emerged on cruel and unusual punishment and pointed out that the nation 's is the only country in the world that allows the execution of juveniles . Prosecutors contended that Simmons was old enough to know right from wrong and challenged the notion that a national consensus had emerged .",

Justice Kennedy , the decisive & quot;swing vote&quot noted that the United was the last remaining nation to abolish the death penalty for minors . Justice Kennedy , the decisive & quot;swing vote&quot comment reignited debate over the Supreme Court consideration of foreign laws and opinions when interpreting the Constitution . On March 1 , 2005 , the Supreme Court declared that the death sentence for crimes committed by 16 and 17 year olds was cruel and unusual punishment , thus violating the 8th Amendment . Justice Kennedy , the decisive & quot;swing vote&quot wrote the majority opinion citing the emotional immaturity of teenagers , the changing national consensus , and the weight of international opinion against executing minors . The dissenting opinions disputed the emotional immaturity of teenagers , the changing national consensus , and the weight of international opinion against executing minors . Justice O'Connor voted with the conservatives , Rehnquist , Thomas and Justice Scalia . In Roper v. Simmons the Supreme Court ruled 5 - to-4 that executing 16- and 17 - year - olds violated the constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment . ruled noted that the brains of adolescents function differently from those of adults and observed that American society believes that adulthood begins at 18 in regard to voting , serving on a jury , or marrying without parental consent . ruled also stated that the & quot;national consensus&quot ; on capital punishment had changed and that the United was the only country that allowed the execution of minors , thus confirming the importance of international opinion .",
